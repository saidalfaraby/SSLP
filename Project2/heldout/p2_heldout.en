to achieve this requires a boarding aid , a lift or a ramp , because a low-floor bus on its own is not enough .
our failure to agree this crucial part of the text would leave disabled people quite literally falling through the crack , a crack for which we would ourselves be responsible .
the rapporteur - to whom I offer my heartfelt thanks - has forged a compromise which seeks to share responsibility for access between bus manufacturers , operators , local planning and transport authorities .
but as we negotiate the final outcome I say to Parliament and the Commission that even a raised kerb at every bus stop can never be the full access solution .
bad parking or obstacles on the pavement can still prevent boarding , whilst a simple manual swing-over ramp , built into the floor of each new bus , is cheap and will work time after time .
yet nine years after this directive was first discussed , when the disability movement for a generation has put accessible public transport at the heart of its demands , those on the opposite side of the House threaten to vote , not simply against the amendment , but to destroy the whole directive .
do they do so on grounds of cost ?
no .
the study of accessible buses commissioned by my own government shows low operating costs outweighing the marginal extra capital costs , while a 14 % increase in passengers brought in extra revenue .
do they do so because of objections from manufacturers ?
no .
a check today , again in my own Member State , shows that British bus manufacturers and British bus operators are unanimous in their view that they want the directive to go through .
do they do so because of a genuine difficulty at all ?
no .
because the parliamentary committee that scrutinised these proposals in detail voted for them unanimously .
Mr President , my only conclusion , as we have heard tonight , is that those who oppose do so because they share the prejudice that disability access is an unnecessary technical detail .
they are wrong .
for a disabled person it means the freedom to travel or the restriction to stay at home .
tonight we have the chance to grant that freedom to vote for accessible public transport .
we must and we will .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , we have before us today the standard European bus directive , on which we adopted a position at first reading .
the rapporteur then was Mr Murphy . Murphy &apos;s Law is of course famous , but I have to say that Mr Murphy did a first-rate job , because he recognised that this directive involves implementing a number of important political principles , namely access for the elderly , children and the disabled .
we are fully in agreement with that .
we need to do something for those groups : buses and public transport must be accessible to them and we want to put all our combined energies into achieving that objective .
so why are we rejecting this directive ?
because at first reading the Commission brought forward a proposal comprising over 100 pages of detailed regulations , and during the first reading debate all the groups agreed to reject the directive for reasons of principle .
now the Commission and the Council have come back with their common position , which is not 100 pages long , but 150 pages .
at first reading we said that we could imagine at most three pages covering the key political principles .
this directive contains some really choice passages of a kind you very rarely find .
for example , on page 17 we have Figure 17 , which is about permissible configurations for rear corner seats , and shows a plan view of the prescribed seat area , with both rear corner seats , in relation to Annex I Section 7.7.8.6.3.4 , and as with aircraft design a maximum radius of 150 mm is prescribed .
I know that we in the European Union have set the radius of curvature for bananas and cucumbers and goodness knows what else , but I find it hard to imagine that we now need to set a radius of curvature for the standard European bus .
the directive also contains a formula that must even be hard for engineers to understand .
I have to say that this document is not a suitable basis for political decision making .
so the position is that designers , bus purchasers , consumer protection organisations and also disabled persons &apos; organisations are in agreement with this directive , but are all very unhappy .
they all say that we want to achieve the objective of using disabled-accessible buses in Europe .
we in the Group of the European People &apos;s Party and European Democrats want a new approach here , which quite simply means limiting ourselves to key policy aspects .
first of all , that means standards for access for the elderly , for children and for disabled persons .
this is extremely important and needs to be guaranteed .
secondly , we want safety standards for drivers and passengers .
thirdly , we want the principle of mutual recognition .
that is why the Group of the European People &apos;s Party and European Democrats is calling for the rejection of the common position and is requesting a vote .
we believe that it is important for us not to make everything in Europe the same .
the European public is also opposed to this desire towards sameness .
we wish to see mutual recognition .
I have confidence in British , French and German buses , and that is how things should remain .
Mr President , at first reading of this directive , Parliament indicated very clearly to the Council and the Commission that it wished to replace the detailed legislation with general guidelines and to allow a technical committee to prescribe the detailed specifications .
however , the Council &apos; s common position rides roughshod over Parliament . the Council has not in any way taken account of Parliament &apos; s firm repudiation of detailed legislation .
the report is about more than just buses .
it is about the way in which the EU is to legislate .
I am not of course opposed to making sure that people with disabilities can use European buses .
what I am opposed to is the mode of procedure .
I find it quite unreasonable that , as a politician , I should have to take decisions about how many millimetres bus door handles and luggage racks should measure .
in my own country , the EU is often made into a laughing-stock for meddling and for regulating in too much detail .
people quite rightly question an EU that is in many ways unwieldy and bent on regulating .
MEPs &apos; credibility is brought into question if we take decisions about things we do not know anything about .
an example is Annex V of the Council &apos; s common position .
I am not ashamed to say that I do not understand the formula according to which the closing power of automatic doors is to be calculated .
I do not want to contribute to making ourselves and the EU into laughing-stocks .
despite the fact that I was not involved in the first reading in 1988 , I would remind this Parliament that it voted 485 to 1 in favour of the general guidelines rather than the detailed legislation .
why should Parliament change its mind now ?
for the Swedish Conservative Party , this was an important issue in the 1999 elections .
I was elected on a mandate to combat politicians &apos; inability to leave things alone .
I cannot therefore vote in favour of the Council &apos; s common position .
I would therefore call upon the whole Parliament to vote in favour of Amendment No 9 , tabled by my colleague Mr Lehne and rejecting the Council &apos; s common position .
Mr President , firstly , I would like to thank the rapporteur , Mr Miller , as well as the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market , whose work has enabled this case to be brought to a successful conclusion .
as you no doubt recall , this proposal for a directive on the construction of buses and coaches gave rise to lengthy and involved debates at first reading .
this draft has been before us for three years already .
we have come a long way since then .
a consensus has been reached between the Council , Parliament and Commission .
as well as the institutions , the various parties involved such as bus and coach manufacturers , public transport operators and user groups , including those which represent passengers with reduced mobility , have also arrived at a consensus .
that is why we welcome the work of the rapporteur , who succeeded in bringing together some often divergent interests .
it is now possible for the proposal to be adopted quickly , which will allow the safety of buses and their passengers to be improved .
the Commission can accept the eight amendments tabled by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market , either in full or in principle .
amendments Nos 1 , 7 and 8 are acceptable as they stand .
amendments Nos 2 , 3 and 5 , which relate to the permissible slope of the bus &apos; s floor area , are acceptable in principle , but may , of course , be reviewed at the drafting stage .
amendment No 4 , which gives a list of people with reduced mobility , will most probably be challenged by Member States , as it introduces the risk of excluding some categories of users .
would it not be better retain the general definition , which is , for that very reason , more comprehensive ?
finally , Amendment No 6 , which seeks to change the figure of the wheelchair , is acceptable in principle , but not in the form proposed in the report .
the reference to an ISO standard or to an authorised diagram , as the rapporteur proposes in Amendment No 10 , would be preferable , bearing in mind , however , that we must ensure that size , shape and weight of the wheelchair , together with its occupant , are compatible with the physical characteristics of access areas .
on the other hand , the Commission does not wish to repeat the debate held at first reading on the regulatory approach to vehicles .
we do not , therefore , endorse the idea of challenging the timeliness of a directive , by which I am referring to Amendment No 9 .
to sum up , the Commission can accept Amendments Nos 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 and 10 in principle and can accept Amendments Nos 1 , 7 and 8 .
I want to reply to Mr Harbour on this question of principle .
since Lisbon , when we discussed new proposals , we must consider alternatives .
for instance , we are talking about disabilities at the moment .
I have had a lot of discussion about design standards for the disabled in the information society to try to find ways to make all the tools for the information society available for people with different kinds of disabilities .
we should try to analyse when a new approach directive can be used vis-à-vis old approach directives .
we must see what type of regulatory reforms we can have which serve this purpose in an easier way .
I do not want to have this debate now because we have opened it for the future proposal .
this has progressed so far that the Commission proposes to accept it in the way I have presented .
thank you , Commissioner .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
Community incentive measures in employment
the next item is the report ( A5-0018 / 2001 ) by Mrs Jensen , on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs , on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council decision on Community incentive measures in the field of employment &#91; COM ( 2000 ) 459 - C5-0384 / 2000 - 2000 / 0195 ( cod ) &#93; .
Mr President , I should like to begin by thanking the shadow rapporteurs from the other parties for cooperating so well on this report .
I think it is to be welcomed that we can muster a broad majority for a proposal that extends Parliament &apos; s earlier decisions .
by means of this proposal , we are establishing the framework for the EU &apos; s employment policy over the next five years .
employment policy is based , of course , upon what we call open coordination which , most recently at the Lisbon Summit , has been highlighted as a method that may be used within many other areas of policy .
open coordination means that countries may use different methods of achieving common goals .
and the common goal in this case is higher employment .
what we have here are recommended guidelines for the policies of the Member States .
countries must report on what they are doing to make the unemployed better able to meet the demands of the labour market .
encouragement must be given to the spirit of enterprise and to flexibility in the labour market , and countries must work to promote a better relationship between work and family life .
this reporting , carried out by the Member States every year , therefore forms the point of departure for the Commission &apos; s annual report on employment in the EU which , together with the Commission &apos; s analyses and statistics concerning development , forms the basis for the Council &apos; s recommendation to the individual countries .
the process is open .
there is a free choice of policy , and if a country goes down a markedly different path than the one recommended , it can be criticised , but nothing more .
is the process too informal , then ?
a whole lot of reports , meetings and conferences and a whole lot of words , but no certainty that the objectives will be achieved .
on the surface of it , the process is indeed perhaps not formal enough . however , this policy whereby countries measure their efforts against each other and exchange experiences - benchmarking and employment of best practices , to use the modern terminology - means that a broader public gets to see which countries are doing well and which less well .
to a large extent , open coordination works by becoming a subject in the public and national debate about employment policy .
in those countries where youth unemployment is high , the public is bound to ask how it can be that their politicians are not achieving the same good results as politicians in other countries .
is there anything we can learn from the efforts of other countries ?
transparency , understood as openness to the public , is in actual fact a very important agent in this process .
we therefore want to see more focus upon providing information to the public at large and upon involving the parties in the labour market , together with local and regional authorities , to a much greater extent than is contemplated in the Commission &apos; s proposal .
Article 129 provides , of course , for the possibility of introducing pilot projects .
we want an exchange of information about the ways and means of involvement at local level .
this could be a pilot project .
there is no question of our having new projects which mimic practices with which the Social Fund has familiarised us .
it is about developing analyses , knowledge and information about the whys and wherefores of local and regional involvement in employment policy .
by means of its communication concerning the role of local and regional authorities , the Commission has already made a start upon work of this kind .
in this year &apos; s Budget , Parliament too has introduced a new budget line for preparative initiatives to promote local participation in employment policy .
we have done this precisely to promote a broader knowledge of European employment strategy .
by including in this proposal the role of local and regional authorities in employment policy , we ensure that there is a legal basis for this initiative .
when , in this way , we ask the Commission to do more work than is contemplated in the Commission &apos; s own proposal , then appropriations must of course follow , and my report therefore proposes an increase in appropriations to EUR 65 million in contrast to the Commission &apos; s proposal of EUR 55 million .
to put it briefly , the open coordination method must be open in two senses .
it must be open in the sense that countries retain the freedom to organise their own policies and that there must be a number of ways to achieve the same objectives . however , it must also be open in the sense that the general public is involved far more than it is at present .
the policy on employment , or Luxembourg process , is to be commended , but why does it have to be a matter of such secrecy ?
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , this morning President Prodi reported that over a million new jobs were created in Europe last year , and that two-thirds of these were for women .
this demonstrates that employment programmes and work in this area can have very positive effects .
I also believe that the method adopted by the Commission is the right one , that is a combination of benchmarking and promoting best practice with a view to making Europe the world leader in the knowledge-based society .
the Commission has also applied its funding very carefully .
expenditure was only 50 % of commitments .
so a great deal has been achieved with very limited means , which is particularly commendable .
and perhaps it will also be possible to trim administrative expenditure further in future .
the potential is certainly there .
on the other hand , we should do everything in our power to improve and extend this programme in future .
the relevant committee has made appropriate proposals to this effect , and the European Parliament would be proud if the positive achievements of the past year could be carried forward .
in the field of information technology alone - the information society - we will be unable to fill around a million jobs by 2004 because of inadequate training .
I believe that it is a great challenge for us to create new , interesting and good jobs in this area and also in the field of biotechnology , where we need research to solve the problems associated with BSE . in short , we specifically need to invest in these new areas .
Mr President , Commissioner , the Commission proposal has the basic objective of encouraging cooperation between the Member States in terms of analysis , research and monitoring of employment policy , determining best practices and promoting the exchange and transfer of information and experiences .
we therefore fully support the Commission proposal , although I feel that it could be improved on some points which , broadly speaking , are as follows : firstly , and with regard to the planned Community measures , one of them supports a more strategic approach to employment in the Union , through analysis and evaluation of the factors that explain employment tendencies , the general political framework , etc .
on this point the Commission proposal does not envisage that the analysis and evaluation will be conducted in a specific way , for men and for women , something that I consider to be essential if we take into account that unemployment in Europe is largely among women .
it is not excessive to say that , if employment among women were not taken into account , in some regions of the Union there would even be full employment .
with this in mind , and given that employment incentive measures must be one of the key tools for developing equal opportunities , we need to consider what women &apos; s employment needs are .
we therefore need to consider which are the studies aimed at offering more childcare and social assistance in the home .
in this respect , we need to ensure that there is sufficient supply of quality services , particularly when dealing with dependants , which in the majority of cases are the responsibility of women .
we therefore need to encourage the incorporation of women into the labour market and encourage them to remain in it , with an equal distribution of family responsibilities between men and women .
we need to take into account the reinsertion of women and , without any doubt , differentiating between the studies by sex would help us to understand the problems that this raises .
Mr President , this evening , we have returned to the European Parliament , at 11.40 p.m. , to discuss the document on the Community incentive measures in employment , an extremely important document which calls not only for our presence here but also for that of Commissioner Diamantopoulou , who is thus demonstrating a certain concern for employment issues .
moreover , since 14 February , Valentine &apos;s Day is only a quarter of an hour away , I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate all lovers : I hope that there are some in this rough , tough , severe Parliament as well .
with regard to the document under consideration , I have tabled an amendment on behalf of the Group of the European People &apos;s Party calling for the scope of the directive to include an analysis of policy developments from the viewpoints of certain categories of people such as the elderly , the disabled and other vulnerable groups .
Mr President , this programme appropriates EUR 55 million over five years , chiefly to statistics and the drawing up of documentation on the employment strategy ; we are talking mainly about aid to the Member States to achieve the above statistics .
a small proportion of the amount , which I feel should be increased , is for pilot projects intended to identify new forms of employment and work .
in my opinion , these should certainly include - as Commissioner Diamantopoulou said in her first speech - the new activity of caring for the ever-increasing number of elderly and disabled people carried out by young workers who are able to find work in this field and , at the same time , make life easier for the elderly .
I have already tabled this amendment in committee , Mr President , but I am afraid that the left-wing section of Parliament , the socialists that is , rejected it .
tomorrow morning , I shall request a vote by name on this amendment , although I am sure that this will not be necessary and that it will be accepted unanimously .
I truly hope that Europe will concern itself , at last , with elderly and disabled people in the field of employment .
Mr President , first of all I want to say to the previous speaker , Mr Fatuzzo , that I am sorry that we in the Group of the Party of European Socialists are unable to support his amendments , for they simply do not fit into this context .
back to the report , however .
first of all , I want to congratulate the rapporteur .
there is reason for doing so , for this is Mrs Jensen &apos; s first report , and it is also a very good piece of work she has done .
as we all know , the report was , of course , adopted by a very large majority of the committee .
that is gratifying , for this is a very important piece of work .
this decision must ensure that the employment policy we talk so much about is not just a matter of fine words , but that these are in actual fact backed by vigorous action .
nor must there be any doubt that we in the Group of the Party of European Socialists support open coordination whenever this is the most effective tool for achieving the desired objectives .
employment policy is so important because it is the test run for the open coordination method , and it is of the very greatest importance to show that this method is being taken seriously and is producing the desired results .
employment policy will simply be a model for many of the other areas - which are already part of the ambitious plan adopted in Lisbon last spring - in which we should also like to use the open coordination method .
and in the next few weeks , when Heads of State and Government take the Commission &apos; s telling-off seriously and give some impetus to the many outstanding initiatives in the wake of the Lisbon Summit , we shall hopefully also have it confirmed that the open coordination method can be used .
the incentive measures must support employment policy , and that is why the incentive measures are important .
I am therefore very pleased that we in the committees were able to reach agreement on a series of amendments and improvements to the Commission &apos; s proposal .
these amendments relate to five different points .
first of all , information must be provided about employment policy .
secondly , the parties in the labour market , together with the relevant local and regional authorities , must be involved .
thirdly , the focus must be placed upon equal opportunities for men and women , in which connection I should like to thank the Committee on Women &apos; s Rights and Equal Opportunities .
fourthly , an assessment and revision of the open coordination method must be set in motion . and fifthly , the programme must be extended to include pilot projects as well .
what , in other words , we are concerned with here is a quite extensive alteration to the incentive measures which , in a way , were good enough originally .
in this way , we have extended their area of application , and I therefore also hope that , together , we can increase the financial resources we have for implementing the measures so that it will not in any case be possible to accuse Parliament of only producing fine words and not backing them up with genuine action .
I hope that the Commission and the Council are ready to demonstrate the same drive that we have tried to demonstrate here in Parliament .
Mr President , Commissioner , I am speaking on behalf of the Italian radicals .
despite Mrs Jensen &apos;s fine work , I feel that this report is not of great significance .
I know that there is effectively a need to do what the Commission , through its proposal , and the Treaties themselves call for , namely to combine best practices with all speed , to promote innovative processes and approaches and to assess the results .
I do not feel , however , that , in order to do this , there is still a need in the Europe of today to invest EUR 55 million over a small number of years in order to produce more detailed analyses , to attempt to find links between the experiences of the different countries and to promote cooperation - although it is not clear what this means in terms of employment - between the individual countries .
do we really believe that , in order to carry out benchmarking , today , we need to perform once again yet more studies , to sprinkle euro dust on a thousand small more or less nepotistic channels - some to the trade unions , some to the different business organisations , some to the non-governmental organisations - to finance new studies which will end up , covered in dust , taking up space on the shelves of libraries ?
Mr President , I really do not think we need this .
we waste time , we confuse the European unemployed , but we do not carry out those reforms which are truly necessary and with which we are all familiar .
a few minutes ago , in this Chamber , we were talking about groups of people who are disadvantaged in terms of employment .
Mr President , I disagree with the previous speaker so first of all I would like to congratulate the rapporteur , Mrs Jensen , on this comprehensive report .
indeed , there is much that we can support in this report , in particular the emphasis given to the proposed Community-level / local-level mixed approach to employment policy .
in the Committee on Women &apos;s Rights and Equal Opportunities we emphasise that the analysis and evaluation of this action in the field of employment should be carried out on a gender-specific basis , given that women are bearing the brunt of unemployment in Europe .
Commissioner , the Lisbon objectives of bringing up the employment rates for women , a target for 2010 of 60 % can already be considered too ambitious .
in the Kingdom of Spain where the employment rate of women is probably the lowest in the European Union , it hardly reaches 30 % of the active population .
that is why the Committee on Women &apos;s Rights asked for an analysis of the causes of this tremendous gap : part-time working , pregnancy , parental leave , household responsibilities , etc .
that is why we , Euskal Herritarok , ask all the Members of this House to back all the amendments proposed by the Committee on Women &apos;s Rights and of course the actual report by Mrs Jensen .
Mr President , after the abortive Nice Summit , we would do well to remember an event that gave the EU a great boost : the Luxembourg Employment Summit .
that summit succeeded in convincing the Member States actively to do more to improve employability and adaptability , to establish a new entrepreneurial spirit and to enhance equal opportunities .
since then , model measures in the Member States have been a central plank of Europe &apos;s employment strategy .
a thorough assessment and evaluation of what these have achieved is to take place : reintegration into working life , activities to promote equality of opportunities , elimination of exclusion , and targeted measures to create a suitable environment for setting up small and medium-sized businesses .
are we right in our view that European added value can be created if actions in the Member States are interlinked with Community initiatives and with Community education , training and further education programmes ?
we want to involve local and regional stakeholders more actively by means of pilot projects and therefore call on the Commission to top up the funding it has proposed .
I believe that a priority here is improved coordination of employment and economic policy , which are , after all , two sides of the same coin .
we now need to have the courage to make more of our potential and not only be consulted when the employment policy guidelines are being drawn up - that is not enough .
as a European Parliament we need to get involved on a more consistent basis in the employment week in Brussels in November , whilst here in Strasbourg we should at long last find time to devote a whole day to a debate on the creation of jobs of the future and the implementation of national action plans .
as part of this , proper attention needs to be paid to the achievements of the social partners and the experiences of employees hit by unemployment and assisted by job creation measures .
Mr President , that would be our contribution towards a good campaign on Europe &apos;s employment strategy .
Mr President , a job - work - is the most important means of preventing exclusion .
the European Union is little able to tackle the question of employment directly .
the Luxembourg process , as it is known , with its yearly reports on employment and its approach to best practices and learning by example , is an excellent attempt to reinforce cooperation among Member States and encourage success and transparency .
a big step forward will be the subsequent Luxembourg process , which invests in new technology and uses it to put Europe on the path to growth .
action to bolster employment must focus too on where best to obtain added value , in other words , education and training , research , the adoption of new technology as a tool of growth and , in particular , as one of sustainable growth .
we shall have equality by attending to the matter of public social services , which also make it possible for women to be fully represented in the labour market .
Mr President , I wish , first of all , to congratulate the rapporteur , Mrs Jensen , on the timeliness and the quality of her rapport .
one of the Union &apos; s objectives is to promote a high level of employment .
therefore , within the framework of the Luxembourg process , the Member States have been cooperating in the field of employment policy , and are responsible for selecting specific measures for its implementation .
in fact , it could not be otherwise .
more recently , the Lisbon European Council set the Union the strategic objective of becoming the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world , capable of sustainable economic growth generating more and better jobs and greater social cohesion .
this report seeks to make a contribution towards meeting this new challenge set in Lisbon , covering equal opportunities for men and women in the field of employment , an important pillar in the European Employment Strategy .
the report aims to foster cooperation between Member States in analysis , research and monitoring of labour market policy , identifying best practices and promoting exchanges and transfers of information and experience .
all of this will be flanked by an active information policy , so that Europe &apos; s citizens can easily see what the strategic objectives in the field of employment are .
we must ensure that the social partners and relevant local and regional authorities are involved in this effort , which must be a communal effort .
furthermore , it is equally crucial that a study should be made of infrastructures that help men and women to gain employment and to remain employed , such as crèche places and home help , a point that is made clear in the opinion of the Committee on Women &apos; s Rights and Equal Opportunities .
the European Parliament is already a key player within the consultation process in defining the annual employment guidelines and must now also participate in a quantitative and qualitative evaluation of the effects of the European Employment Strategy in general .
I wish to say a final word about the allocation of resources for employment incentive measures .
the use of public funds must be dealt with in a balanced and extremely rigorous way .
an increased budgetary appropriation in this domain would therefore appear to be something that is essential and to be welcomed .
it must also be emphasised that the allocation of resources must meet real , specific needs and take account of the implementation of the budget for each heading .
Mr President , I too would like to join my colleagues in thanking Mrs Jensen for her report and congratulating her on it .
in the limited time that is available it is important that , as a number of speakers have already touched upon a number of disadvantaged groups or groups who are not doing so well in employment areas , we consider a number of aspects , the three most important ones being : equality of opportunity , equality of access and equality of training .
equality of opportunity must mean that all jobs , all services that are available , are open to all equally .
equality of access means that there should be no physical impediment towards people accessing training or employment opportunities .
equality of education means that people must have the skills that are required for the jobs that are going to be available .
we have moved from a time when there was heavy industrialised and intensive labour areas of industry , to other smaller networks , smaller cooperation .
we need to look more towards giving the skills and training to young people , middle-aged people , elderly people and those living in urban and rural areas to guarantee that they have equality of access to that training and new jobs .
the national action plans on employment , under the Luxembourg process , are very useful to us in ensuring that we use the carrot and stick with the Member States .
we can give extra resources where they are providing good jobs and meeting their targets and we can take them back when they are not doing it .
Mr President , as it is now after midnight , I say to you , Mr President and to you , Commissioner , happy Valentine &apos;s day !
this is a very good report .
I say that without surprise as it is by Mrs Jensen , so of course it is a good report .
however , it was a slightly better report before the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs &apos; improved it &apos; .
some of the amendments that have come through have not made it a better document .
I refer to just two aspects .
the first aspect - taking my life in my hands - refers to some of the amendments of the Committee on Women &apos;s Rights and Equal Opportunities .
I strongly support women &apos;s rights .
I strongly support the rights of young people , of old people , of disabled people and many other minorities .
but only the women have their own committee to speak up for them .
at times , perhaps , their voice drowns out some of the other groups , in my judgment .
I take as an example Article 3.1 ( 1 ) where the original text said : &quot; to the maximum possible extent analysis will be gender-specific &quot; .
I agree with that .
it should be gender-specific to the maximum possible extent .
but the Women &apos;s Committee has taken out the words &quot; to the maximum possible extent &quot; .
apparently &quot; maximum possible &quot; is not quite maximum enough .
I believe it was fine as it was .
I use that as an example , but I am still supportive of women &apos;s rights .
I have my tomato-proof suit on just in case you were thinking of doing something .
the second point concerns the budget .
I believe the Committee on Budgets made a reference to the budget increasing from EUR 50 million to EUR 55 million , but on the basis that this should be proportionate to the implementation .
last year &apos;s budget was EUR 50 million .
only two-thirds of that was spent ; 25 % of that was eaten up by administrative costs .
to go up from EUR 55 million to 65 million - which is the latest amendment - is , in my view , disproportionate .
it is a reflection of the enthusiasm of the committee for this particular project .
sometimes it is all too common that in order to signify the importance of a subject more money is offered to it .
I should like to hope that , increasingly , colleagues could recognise that money is not just a reflection of importance , and that it is possible to vote strongly for a report without increasing the money .
I fear I may have to wait a long time to see that .
given my advancing years it may be my successors who see that approach first .
thank you , Commissioner .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
( the sitting was closed at 12.20 a.m. )
approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting
yesterday &apos; s Minutes have been distributed .
are there any comments ?
Mr President , I refer to the comments made in this Chamber on Monday afternoon with respect to the anti-nuclear demonstration at the Faslane nuclear submarine base in Scotland .
as you are aware , I took part in that demonstration , and I would like to thank all those Members who expressed support for the action that I took when I participated in the largest-ever blockade of the base and was arrested , ironically enough , for committing a breach of the peace .
I just want to say a word to those Members who implied that my actions were somehow irresponsible or inappropriate .
firstly , nuclear weapons are not only immoral and inhumane , they are also illegal .
the International Court of Justice in The Hague ruled that the possession of nuclear weapons is contrary to international law , and this was reaffirmed by a Scottish court in 1999 .
my action on Monday was therefore upholding the law , not breaking it .
secondly , I believe nuclear weapons pose such a threat to all of us that it is legitimate and indeed essential to use all peaceful avenues open to us to try to rid our countries of them .
of course there are parliamentary channels to use to do that , and I use them , but I also believe it is legitimate and essential to use extra-parliamentary channels as well .
it is our responsibility to use them .
a democratic state is not just a gift and right , it is a responsibility .
if citizens do not responsibly demonstrate against the operation of inhumane acts by their governments , the governments become increasingly irresponsive and corrupt .
finally , it is the right and duty of every citizen , elected or not , to use all peaceful avenues to try to uphold international law .
my action on Monday was one further small step in trying to achieve that .
Mr President , in welcoming my brave and gallant colleague , Mrs Lucas , back to the House , I would like to draw to my colleagues &apos; attention that today we will also be visited by the Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland ; who will be received by the President this evening .
in that connection I would like to repeat Mrs Lucas &apos; point that it was implied in this House on Monday that only irresponsible hotheads took part in the protest at Faslane .
I ask Members to note that the leader of the Scottish national church , whom we will welcome here tonight , also took a leading part in that protest .
leading an ecumenical service , he drew attention to the Church &apos;s principled rejection of states &apos; reliance on weapons of mass destruction .
profound opposition to nuclear weapons on both legal and moral grounds is a common position among responsible leaders of opinion , both religious and non-religious , throughout Scotland and throughout this great Union .
Mr President , to pick up on the points that Mrs Lucas has raised , I support the sentiments which she has outlined .
however , I would ask if she could prevail upon her colleagues to desist from claiming some sort of parliamentary immunity every time she gets arrested at Faslane .
long before Mrs Lucas became involved , I had been involved in Faslane for many years and have been arrested there .
I have never once called for parliamentary immunity .
I had my day in court and I had my trial .
I will not go down the road to parliamentary immunity because I want my day in court and I want to make my point and not hide behind some smokescreen .
Mr President , can I just establish for yesterday &apos;s Minutes a correction to my vote .
I intended to vote yes on the Rübig Report .
Mr President , my point also relates to the Minutes .
I wonder if it might be recorded on page 11 in the English version of the Minutes , at Item 8 where we talk about voting time , that the votes commenced at 12.12 p.m.
they were advertised on the screen as commencing at 12.15 p.m. and for that reason some of us missed some of the early votes .
Mr President , regretfully we have learnt that exactly one month after an earthquake devastated El Salvador a similar tremor struck this Central American country again yesterday .
I am sure that our Delegation for Relations with the Countries of Central America and Mexico will set all the machinery in motion to urge the Community authorities , starting with the Commission , to renew their efforts of solidarity with this country .
we will look into this matter .
if you are right , the Minutes will , of course , be corrected , as you say .
( the Minutes were approved )
thank you , Mr Carnero González .
I believe that the House would join you in hoping this .
accession partnership with Turkey
Mr President , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , Commissioner , after lengthy pronouncements and promises , the European Union - or to be more precise , the Helsinki European Council - has formally recognised Turkey as a candidate for membership of the European Union .
and the purpose of our debate and vote today is also to bring Turkey closer to this membership , or , more precisely , to the possibility of opening negotiations .
if , as I would hope , we adopt my report here today and the Council reaches a decision along similar lines , the ball will be well and truly in the Turkish half of the pitch .
Turkey will then have to act .
the time for reaction - as has happened all too often with Turkey - will have passed , and Turkey will have to take the crucial steps .
for it must be clear , ladies and gentlemen - and I include our colleagues from Turkey who may be following this debate today - that the Copenhagen criteria must be fulfilled prior to the opening of negotiations .
we have not negotiated with any candidate before the political criteria were fulfilled .
so in this sense , we are demanding that Turkey meet the same conditions as all the other candidates .
Turkey is neither privileged nor disadvantaged .
that is the essence of my report , and it is also the essence of those paragraphs - which , however , have apparently now been called into question - which aim to ensure that Turkey has the same status as all the other candidates .
after all , it makes little sense to talk about equal treatment for Turkey , and impose the same obligations on Turkey , if we are not prepared to grant it the same rights as well .
and of course it will be a very difficult path - in Turkey , and for Turkey - to fulfil the criteria .
there are at least three significant trends in Turkey : those who are pro-Europe because they support democracy , transparency and respect for human and minority rights ; those who are pro-Europe but have substantial doubts about adopting European values and fundamental rights ; and those who are fundamentally opposed to Europe , largely because they are sceptical about the adoption of the basic rights and values to which we in Europe are committed .
but it is up to Turkey to take the domestic policy decisions .
certainly , I believe that we - this Parliament - should send out a clear signal that the forces in Turkey which want to follow the path towards Europe and full democracy have our support .
and that is the essence of my report as well .
we hope that Turkey will make substantial progress in the coming years .
some people harbour the illusion that negotiations could begin in one or two years &apos; time .
I don &apos;t want to discourage or disappoint anyone , but it will take several years .
but one thing must also be clear , in my view : if it genuinely proves impossible to open negotiations within a specific period - which in my personal opinion should be around five years - because the political criteria have not been fulfilled , the European Union and Turkey must consider another form of partnership .
for we are Turkey &apos;s partners anyway , and we must be good partners .
firstly - I would not wish to deny this - Turkey is a key economic factor .
and indeed , we should not deny this .
secondly , Europe has a significant interest in ensuring that there is at least one stable major country in this crisis-torn region .
thirdly , we have no interest in abandoning Turkey to the Islamic fundamentalists , for we are opposed to all religious or other forms of fundamentalism on principle .
fourthly , there are regional problems to be resolved : improving relations with Greece , and especially the Cyprus issue .
I should like to come back to this point in a moment .
Turkey must understand that we demand every candidate country &apos;s absolute willingness to maintain good relations with its neighbours .
a key element of the preparations for negotiations with Turkey is that it regulates its relations with Greece in a positive way and contributes significantly to the resolution of the Cyprus issue .
it is a difficult issue .
all sides , and everyone concerned , must play their part in settling the Cyprus issue ; this naturally includes the representatives of the Turkish community and especially Turkey itself .
let me conclude with two further brief comments .
firstly , on the Kurdish issue : it goes without saying that resolving the problems with the Kurdish community in Turkey also features on the agenda .
we have stated quite clearly that the use of the Kurdish language - also in the media - and the fostering of , and the opportunity to express , Kurdish identity are key factors in changing the political conditions in Turkey as well .
as far as the Armenia issue is concerned , I personally am opposed to the notion that foreign parliaments should seek to judge history and events which took place a hundred years ago .
but I am also opposed to the exploitation of this issue for nationalist purposes in Turkey .
a more relaxed and , above all , a more active role in the Armenia issue would be helpful .
if Turkey were to take steps to invite its own historians and those from Armenia and third countries to come together to discuss this issue , this would also be a step forward towards a sensible debate about this question .
in this spirit , ladies and gentlemen , I would ask you to adopt my proposal in order to give Turkey the opportunity to prove that it wishes to follow the path towards Europe .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , as the draftsman of the Committee on Budgets &apos; opinion on the Swoboda report concerning the establishment of an Accession Partnership with Turkey , I fully support the document as it stands .
the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy has taken account of all the amendments proposed by the Committee on Budgets .
the following points were important for the Committee on Budgets .
the first appeared to be a budgetary matter , but it is actually a political issue .
the Committee on Budgets called for the appropriations for Turkey to be switched from Heading 4 of the Financial Perspective , i.e. external action , to Heading 7 , i.e. Pre-accession Aid , in order to reflect Turkey &apos;s status as a candidate for accession .
in a further proposed amendment , the Committee on Budgets made it clear that the volume of Community assistance should be determined annually by the budgetary authority , i.e. the Council and Parliament , as part of the budgetary procedure .
two further proposed amendments concerned the need for consultation with Parliament as part of the cooperation with Turkey , firstly when the principles , priorities , intermediate objectives and conditions contained in the Accession Partnership are decided , and , secondly , when appropriate steps are agreed in the event that commitments are not respected by Turkey .
as all the points put forward by the Committee on Budgets have been taken up by the Committee on Foreign Affairs , we are quite satisfied from a budgetary point of view .
indeed , as far as the financial aspects are concerned , the Committee on Foreign Affairs actually went even further , for example with its proposed amendment on Turkey &apos;s inclusion in the other financial instruments .
let me make one last comment : in the coming years , we will all have to push hard for real new money to be made available to Turkey , which is now a candidate country - and indeed to the other candidates for accession - rather than merely bundling the existing programmes together .
without new money , the candidates for accession will be unable to fulfil the criteria which we have established for them .
Mr President , first of all , I have a great deal of respect for Mr Swoboda &apos; s report , which , in particular , deals expertly with a number of technical points relating to Turkey , but , of course , this goes beyond the technical .
we all know that there is a difference between Turkey , a candidate country which is not in a position to engage in accession negotiations yet because the political Copenhagen criteria have not been fulfilled yet , and other candidate countries that are involved in the negotiation process leading to EU membership .
this distinction has been drawn on sensible political grounds .
it will also be reflected in our financial dealings with Turkey , as compared with our dealings with other candidate countries .
I would therefore like to make the point that whilst in general , the positive attitude towards Turkey expressed in the report certainly appeals to our group , we have the feeling it goes a little too far on one particular point , and I would specifically like to hear the Commission &apos; s opinion on this .
I am referring to Amendment No 1 , which states that Turkey should be included in the ISPA and SAPARD financial instruments in order to ensure that all candidate countries are treated equally .
I do not think that such a step constitutes equal treatment in the real sense .
in the past , if the political situation was not to our liking , or if we felt it left something to be desired in certain countries , then we have said that we would take this into account on all kinds of different points .
we would then draw a distinction on the point in question , irrespective as to whether it was a large country or a small one that we had certain political objections to .
only yesterday , I had a detailed discussion with the excellent Turkish Ambassador about these matters .
it comes down to the question of what has to change in a country for it to become a fully-fledged candidate country involved in accession negotiations .
if ISPA and SAPARD are already being discussed - and these instruments were not intended for Turkey hitherto - then Amendment No 1 would mean money being taken out of the budgets intended for the candidate countries currently engaged in accession negotiations .
in other words , we are talking about those countries that have fulfilled the Copenhagen criteria , for example .
I have a feeling this would have a demoralising effect .
I would specifically like to know from the Commission to what extent this would actually have financial implications .
how would Amendment No 1 actually affect the other candidate countries ?
would it mean a cut in the budget for the other candidate countries we are negotiating with , for Turkey &apos; s benefit ?
what exactly is the situation ?
if that were so , I would find it most strange .
or is it perhaps the case that the Financial Perspective could be extended , allowing Amendment No 1 to be implemented without adversely affecting the other candidate countries ?
I think that technically speaking , it would be extremely difficult to effect this budgetary change .
so on this one point , I would very much like a clear answer from the Commission as to the impact that Amendment No 1 will have .
because the fact is that our group has some major doubts about accepting something that will have such a negative impact , particularly on the other candidate countries , with whom negotiations are proceeding well .
that does not seem to us to be fair , and so we should rethink the situation .
if we want to do something for Turkey then there is always the Customs Union .
we are neglecting this at the moment .
I fully understand people &apos; s irritation over this , also in the financial sense .
we must bring these matters to a sound conclusion .
I could not agree more .
if we can do all these things better , technically speaking , by amalgamating instruments for example , then this is what we must do .
but taking budgets away from candidate countries that we are negotiating with over accession , for the benefit of a candidate country that has not yet reached this stage , seems to me to be a very sore point .
on behalf of my group , I would be grateful if the Commission could tell us just exactly what the score is .
Mr President , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , Turkey has been offered a partnership agreement and , from a procedural point of view , it is right that we should now give this partnership agreement a legal basis , even though Turkey has not yet presented a national programme which will allow us to judge just how far it is prepared to assimilate the various points of the partnership agreement .
however , Mr Swoboda &apos;s report is not a standard procedural report , because the country which is the subject of the report is not a standard candidate country .
it is a large country and it is very different from the other candidate countries .
this difference provokes certain general comments .
Turkey &apos;s candidacy puts not just Turkey , but the European Union to the test .
it is not just Turkey , ladies and gentlemen , which is sitting exams in order to become a member .
in this particular case , the European Union is also sitting exams , in numerous subjects .
first of all , in the subject of religious tolerance .
the opinion which , I think , prevails among most European citizens , is that a different religion should not be an obstacle to the accession of a new member .
in democratic Europe , we are proud of our religious tolerance , but we have never been asked to put it to the test as we are now .
it is a crucial test of the sincerity of our declarations and we must not flunk it .
the second exam which we are sitting is in powers of persuasion , i.e. our ability to persuade Turkey of the value of substantive acceptance of our democratic institutions .
I stress substantive acceptance because Turkey has not refused to accept democracy formally ; hardly anyone in the world today does .
however , there is a wide body of opinion which believes that a democratic state starts and ends with a multi-party system and regular elections .
obviously that will not suffice .
it is here , with the substantive acceptance of democracy , that Turkey &apos;s development post-Helsinki gives rise to serious questions .
Turkey creates the impression , following the European Council &apos;s gesture in December 1999 , which was welcomed joyfully by the Turkish people , that it is moving away from - rather than towards - a substantive democracy .
the amnesty law passed freed many a criminal ; but it did not free people sentenced for daring to express an opinion or talk their own language .
Leyla Zana , the European Parliament Sakharov prizewinner , is still in jail .
the state of emergency persists in south-eastern Turkey and cadres of the legal Kurdish party HADEP have disappeared in the region and been declared missing .
the tragedy provoked when the security forces stormed the jails caused public outrage .
we expect to see Turkey move forward ; instead all we see is it moving backwards .
we are also sitting exams in our ability to persuade Turkey of the value of peaceful relations between former enemies .
here Turkey &apos;s conduct shows a regressive trend .
we expect words of reconciliation on Cyprus ; instead all we hear is the clang of arms .
ladies and gentlemen , in the Middle Ages , Turkey and its army came knocking on Europe &apos;s door in Vienna .
the door remained closed .
today Turkey is again knocking on our door , this time in peace , because over the intervening centuries , the real power has passed not to the advocates of military force but to the powers of liberty , democracy , rationalism and science .
herein lies the power of Great Europe and anyone who wants to share in Europe &apos;s greatness must truly espouse its principles ; otherwise the door to Europe will remain firmly closed .
Mr President , I would like to thank Mr Swoboda for his speech and also the report .
my group supports the regulation , not only because of its technical and financial value to Turkey , but also for the political message it sends .
the regulation is a confidence-building measure .
it shows we treat Turkey &apos;s candidacy for European membership with the respect that it surely deserves .
it squares Turkey &apos;s candidacy with that of the other states , sending a signal that we will be fair and straightforward with Turkey and setting an example of the political consistency that we expect and require from the Turks .
the regulation will trigger a raft of reforms .
it is certain that the quality and pace of reform in Turkey will be driven by the developing relationship with the European Union .
the next step must be the national plan , published quickly and fully responding to the Accession Partnership programme .
we need this national plan to ensure that the momentum that supports European integration in Turkey does not diminish .
we in the Liberal Group will assess this national programme for reform critically but fairly .
Mr President , the Council &apos; s proposed regulation is a logical successor to the Helsinki decisions .
if a country is a candidate country then a clear strategy and a clear financing package are required , just as they are for other candidate countries .
it is a sound proposal and Mr Swoboda &apos; s amendments improve on it .
what is currently more interesting to my mind , is the question as to whether Turkey and the European Union have drawn closer together since the Helsinki decisions .
my own group is still facing the same dilemma on that level .
as you all know , we were , and still are , highly critical of the Turkish Government &apos; s record as regards human rights , the position of the Kurds and the dominant position of the army .
the crucial question then , and now , is what can , and must , the EU do to improve the situation ?
the answer then , and now , is that the only way to achieve this is through dialogue , in the context of enlargement and membership .
this is also because the forces we are in touch with , the progressive forces , regard Europe &apos; s support as something that will help them on their way to change .
the question now is does this strategy work ?
I fear it is too early to say because the picture is extremely mixed .
let me cite the prisoners &apos; riot by way of example .
of course it was a step in the right direction to propose that , henceforth , there should no longer be thirty prisoners to one large cell , rather there should be single occupancy , or only a few people to a cell .
naturally , that is the kind of improvement we have always pushed for .
however , the picture is greatly obscured by the fact that the regime in prisons is exactly as it always was .
and this regime goes hand in hand with acts of torture , which are now said to be easier to perpetrate because of the individual cells .
my group &apos;s response is that we must continue to pursue this strategy , but - and Mr Swoboda has also reminded us of this - there is absolutely no guarantee of success .
the price of accession is high , high for the army and for the supporters of the monolithic unified state .
can we compel , or perhaps entice them to pay this price ?
it is the European Union &apos; s responsibility to ask this question and have a crack at it .
with that in mind , and as I said before , the regulation is a positive step and the amendments represent an improvement .
however , it is up to Turkey - and that , I think , is what needs to emerge from this debate - to see whether these overtures towards the European Union are sincerely meant , because my group &apos; s motto still holds good : no radical reforms without the prospect of membership , but without radical reforms , no prospect of membership .
Mr President , Mr Swoboda &apos;s proposals for the Council regulation are appropriate , in my view .
I think they would enhance the regulation .
I would also like to thank him very much for his explanations .
I do not want to repeat the criticism of the situation in Turkey which has already been expressed by Mr Swoboda , Mr Lagendijk and Mr Oostlander .
the situation has certainly not improved in recent weeks and months .
our parliamentary group recently sent a delegation to Turkey ; it came back with devastating reports from people affected , which we would gladly make available to the Commission , the Council Presidency or our parliamentary colleagues .
but I do not want to go into that here .
Mr Swoboda , you said that the ball is now well and truly in the Turkish half of the pitch .
what would be the result of this Austrian footballing analogy , I wonder ?
which side will score ?
and if it is at the EU &apos;s end , is it an own goal ?
what we need , as I am sure you will agree , is for this process to set the ball rolling towards democracy , human rights , and the fulfilment of the Copenhagen criteria .
but I believe that in Turkey , the ball - which really is in the Turkish half of the pitch - is viewed in a completely different way .
I believe that what has happened recently has been provocation . it is not an attempt to pursue the application for EU membership towards its proper goal ; it is an end in itself , in order to secure financial resources , to utilise the benefits conferred by the Customs Union , or even to ensure that the criticism of the situation in Turkey is toned down .
this brings me to the real issue which I would like to raise .
alongside the necessary and very candid criticism of the situation in Turkey , should we not be examining our own policies very critically as well ?
since Helsinki - and , indeed , in Helsinki - it seems as if the Council and Commission have been the victims of their own propaganda , increasingly having to justify the fact that progress has been made .
Mr Verheugen , you informed us here on 14 November that we have , and I quote , &quot; good cause to hope that we will achieve precisely what we set out to achieve , i.e. that our policy will help the forces of reform in Turkey give new impetus to the reform process and press on with reform ... &quot; .
I would claim that the reality is very different .
I realise that diplomacy often has to work very cautiously , but we should not be taken in by our own propaganda , or Turkey &apos;s . we should approach the debate honestly and strengthen the forces of reform , thus opening the way for Turkey into the European Union .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , our position on Turkey &apos; s accession to the European Union is well known .
we clearly expressed this position in Parliament &apos; s part-session last November during the debate on the report on the progress of Turkey &apos; s preparations for accession .
we have nothing against the great Turkish nation or against its close relationship with the European Union .
in fact , the opposite is true . we simply feel that the traditional cautiousness that has characterised our attitude to Turkey &apos; s candidature has been changed without any coherent political debate on the matter .
can the reasons for our cautiousness have disappeared or become less pressing ?
first of all , there is the geographical problem : do we no longer think that just a small portion of Turkey &apos; s territory is actually part of the European continent ?
what new doctrine on the shape of Europe allows us to frame this new concept of external borders that would result from Turkey &apos; s inclusion in the Union ?
must Europe gain a new border , one that is not only outside Europe but which is riven with war and conflict ?
we only have to think of the possibility of being surrounded by countries such as Iran , Iraq or Syria .
what can we say about the contrast with the democratic model shared by all Europeans , brought about by the countless restrictions that are , unfortunately , still being imposed in Turkey on the exercise of fundamental rights ?
how can we reconcile Turkey &apos; s accession to the Union with its ongoing military conflict with Greece over Cyprus ? what about the Kurdish question , which is making no progress ?
and what of the military &apos; s influence over the regime which is still powerful ? lastly , does no one question the impact that the size of Turkey &apos; s population will have on the social and economic cohesion of an enlarged Europe ?
have all these issues changed or become significantly less serious ?
we do not think so . we even think that we are not alone in holding this opinion .
the more optimistic among you will say that we are the ones who are failing to see the good progress that has been made to date .
is this the case ?
let us see what the Commission &apos; s latest report on the Turkish situation has to say .
it does indeed acknowledge considerable progress in the field of macro-economic stability and in improving the most striking imbalances in Turkey &apos; s economy .
we are not naïve and realise that this is probably what counts .
Turkey &apos; s economic importance for the European Union today is considerable .
in 2000 , for example , the European Union was responsible for 52.9 % of Turkey &apos; s imports and 53.1 % of its exports .
obviously , we cannot ignore this fact .
nevertheless , we strongly recommend reading this report in the light of respect for freedom of expression and of association , which the Commission has stated are being limited .
the report should be read in the light of the situation in the field of economic , social and cultural rights , which the document says have not changed since 1999 , in the light of the judicial system , whose functioning has still not been improved , and of corruption , which is still taking place at worrying levels .
the report deals with the military dimension of the regime , torture and abuse , which are far from being totally eradicated and which lead the Commission to conclude that , and I quote , &apos; with regard to the previous year &apos; - 1999 - &apos; the situation on the ground has not improved and Turkey is not systematically fulfilling the Copenhagen political criteria &apos; .
Mr President , the proposal for a Council regulation that we are going to vote on tomorrow creates a legal framework which will enable Turkey to benefit from a pre-accession strategy , just like the other candidate countries .
this strategy provides for a kind of suspensive clause , which will be triggered specifically if there is insufficient progress towards fulfilment of the Copenhagen criteria .
Parliament wants to be involved in this evaluation process , which is all well and good .
in the meantime , however , given the real framework drawn up by the Commission itself , we need to ask whether this suspensive clause will be anything more than an example of political hypocrisy .
otherwise , we will only be able to conclude that what the Commission is proposing for Turkey gives partnership for accession with one hand and , with the other , suspends it indefinitely .
Mr President , in December 1999 , the Helsinki European Council accorded Turkey EU candidate country status ; a radical decision given the distinctly tricky mutual relations of previous decades .
at any rate , it was a step too far for our taste .
after all , the political and cultural divide between the two parties is far too wide .
ongoing tensions bear this out .
consider for example the current diplomatic clash between Paris and Ankara over the historical interpretation of the dreadful fate of the Armenian minority within the Osman Empire in 1915 .
however , awarding Turkey candidate country status means that Europe now has certain obligations .
the Commission , and not least the rapporteur , are approaching this in a fair and reasonable way , and so we will support Mr Swoboda &apos; s report .
two elements of the proposed Accession Partnership have reinforced this decision .
firstly , the strengthening of the Customs Union between the European Community and Turkey , our alternative to the inevitable mutual trials that would result from Turkey &apos; s accession to the EU .
secondly , Article 4 of the Commission proposal .
if Turkey absolutely fails to make any discernible progress in fulfilling the Copenhagen accession criteria , i.e. if it fails to establish a functioning democratic constitutional state with protection for minorities , then we expect the Council and the Commission to take &apos; appropriate measures &apos; in conformity with Article 4 .
rapporteur Swoboda is right , in this specific case , to call for consultation of Parliament , which would be acting within the scope of its authority .
Mr President , Ankara has still not set a course for Europe by implementing an unequivocal policy of reform .
yet it is still being given the chance to join the EU .
we must now wait for a clear Turkish response , and that will demand a lot of patience on Europe &apos; s part .
however , we must not let ourselves be talked into simply disregarding our carefully compiled accession criteria for that reason .
Mr President , in principle , we welcome any attempt to improve conditions in Turkey and bring the country closer to the European Union .
but the question is under what conditions and with what financial resources .
a great deal has been said , quite rightly , about the human rights problems in Turkey , the Kurdish issue , and even recognition of the genocide against the Armenian people .
I myself visited Turkey as a trial observer a few months ago at the invitation of a group of students , and it was not a very encouraging experience .
it is interesting to note , for example , that the rapporteur himself , who has tabled a most interesting report , has changed his views on Turkey over recent years .
but we should not reproach him for doing so , for everyone has the right to alter their opinion .
financial support for Turkey to boost those forces which want to move closer to Europe and achieve further improvements in democratic conditions must take place in tandem with observation of the human rights situation , however , and must not reduce the financial resources earmarked for other countries .
so we are interested in the TDI &apos;s idea of setting up a kind of Council of the Wise , which would monitor human rights on an ongoing basis and make funding for specific projects conditional on improvements in this area .
Mr President , the Accession Partnership sets out a series of important and challenging priorities for Turkey to address as part of its preparations for European Union membership .
it will certainly test the resolve of Turkey to carry out much-needed reforms in the area of human rights .
a very topical aspect of this relates to freedom of expression , the functioning of the judicial system and the conditions in Turkish prisons .
this has been mentioned by previous speakers this morning and I spoke on this subject during our debate last month .
following the adoption of a resolution by this House on the situation in Turkish prisons , I wrote to the Turkish authorities drawing particular attention to the request that Members of this Parliament should visit Turkish prisons to see the situation for themselves .
on 5 February , I received a reply from the Turkish Ambassador informing me that the Turkish Ministry of Justice was willing to allow a delegation of MEPs to visit F-type prisons in order to see some of the problems and the steps being taken to overcome them .
to my mind , this confirms the willingness of the Turkish authorities to engage with us in a positive and open manner .
it also demonstrates that some understanding for the Turkish situation , some balance rather than a constant barrage of politically motivated reproach , is more likely to lead to improvement in those areas where we have justified criticisms .
constant references to events which took place generations ago in different circumstances should be avoided .
these merely serve to sustain generalised , stereotypical , negative images of Turkey and the Turkish peoples .
in this context , Parliament &apos;s facilities should not be used for exhibitions designed to whip up hatred and I hope that this sentiment will be conveyed by the President to the Quaestors .
let us look forward rather than constantly harking back .
we support the Swoboda report and the sensible amendments tabled by the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy .
Mr President , when I am in Turkey , I am always told that the European Parliament is Turkey &apos;s enemy .
here today , we have made it clear that this accusation is untrue .
and here today , our colleagues from the Turkish Parliament are listening to us and following the debate .
I would like to tell them something : we have no great interest in constantly talking about what is wrong in Turkey , but let me explain why we express criticism when they exercise their mandate in Turkey .
we are politicians , and we rightly ask about the politicians .
I have here a quote from a Turkish newspaper , not a Kurdish organisation &apos;s newspaper , and with your permission , I would like to read you an excerpt . it says , &quot; Serdar Tanis , Chairman of HADEP in Silopi , and Ebubekir Deniz , HADEP secretary , have disappeared .
on 25 January , they were summoned by the gendarmerie to the gendarmerie station in Silopi and have not been seen since . &quot;
I think this is our problem .
if this type of thing occurs again and again in Turkey and nothing is done about it , people will have to accept that our criticism is justified .
then they will have to admit that we are right to adopt a highly critical approach to the Turkish issue .
Mr President , first and foremost I too would like , on behalf of the ELDR Group , to congratulate Mr Swoboda on his excellent report and the measured words of his introduction .
this is another small but still very important step on the long road leading to Turkey &apos; s accession to the European Union .
there are still a great many obstacles to be overcome along the way .
the political reforms and human rights are of course the first areas to spring to mind , but there are also problems with the economic reforms and Turkey must also satisfy requirements pertaining to environmental legislation .
there is nothing unusual at all in the fact that Europe is helping Turkey on its way .
however , we do expect that in return , Turkey will take our criticism seriously in the same spirit of trust and cooperation .
the Swoboda report is a technical-financial report that follows logically from the Helsinki conclusions .
but reading between the lines , it does highlight a very important message , namely Turkey belongs in Europe .
the ELDR Group wholeheartedly supports this fundamental message .
we are therefore disappointed that other noises are often to be heard from this Parliament .
in particular , noises are occasionally heard from the right side of the House to the effect that Europe should remain a Christian club where Muslims are not welcome .
we repudiate that kind of intolerance .
Europe is a secular Community , a Community of equal rights , religious freedom and openness .
although there is still a long way to go , particularly in the field of human rights , Turkey will belong to this Europe one day .
Mr President , we oppose Turkey &apos;s accession to the European Union because we are certain that the people of Turkey have nothing to gain .
on the contrary , even those in Turkey who believed that its accession would help democratise the country have come to realise , since Turkey was granted candidate status of the European Union , that the opposite is true .
and , if you believed your own declarations on democracy and human rights , declarations which come thick and fast , you would not spend a single euro of the European Union taxpayers &apos; money supporting a military regime which crassly tramples all over human rights .
the money being given to the Turkish Government is in fact being spent on the continued repression of the Kurdish people and the refusal to find a political solution to the Kurdish problem .
it is being spent on the continuing occupation of 38 % of Cyprus and the solution , Mr Swoboda , does not lie in Greece or Cyprus , it lies in an end to this occupation and in the application of the UNO resolutions .
and yet , even recently , Turkish leaders stated that the Cyprus problem was resolved in 1974 .
the European Union &apos;s overtures to and funds for Turkey are encouraging the regime to continue and extend its inhumane , repressive policies and are being cited by the regime at home as Europe &apos;s acknowledgement of the fact that Turkey is a democratic country .
which is why our feelings of solidarity and brotherhood with the people of Turkey who suffer this policy require that we vote against the Council &apos;s proposal , which also illustrates just how hypocritical these declarations about democracy and the Swoboda report are .
Mr President , on 8 November the Commission adopted the reports for the year 2000 on the progress made towards accession by each of the 15 countries .
it considered that all of them , with only the exception of Turkey , were observing the political criteria set in Copenhagen .
despite that , a fortnight afterwards , Turkey attended for the first time the fourth conference on the European Union social funds .
during the summit in Nice , Turkey promised that the new F-type prisons where physical and psychological torture exist would no longer be used .
we all ought to read the report of the human rights mission from 26 December until New Year &apos;s Eve .
this report has been presented in Brussels and shows the desperate situation of hundreds of prisoners in Turkish prisons , in particular those of Kurdish origin .
Article 4 of the proposal dealt with by Mr Swoboda should be implemented immediately .
we do not need to go any further . this must be stopped right now .
otherwise , is this the right way to guarantee the promotion of Kurdish identity ?
as Mr Brie has pointed out , reality contradicts us .
Mr President , Commissioner , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , Turkey is the key country above all others in creating good relations between the Christian and the Muslim worlds .
this fact can never be underestimated - especially in the light of the situation that Turkey is officially a secular state , while its citizens are overwhelmingly Muslims .
at the same time , modern Turkey is also the second land of the Bible , where Saint Paul built up his first Christian congregations .
my first question to the Commissioner and the Council is therefore : in which way are you prepared to help promote religious dialogue between Christians and Muslims ?
my second question is : what concrete measures are being taken to strengthen religious freedom in Turkey , the whole of the Middle East and North Africa ?
there are many of us wondering , especially millions of Coptic Christians in Egypt .
I would like to discuss a practical case in Turkey .
on 22 February the trial of the Syrian Christian priest Yusuf Akbulut will continue from December last year before the State Security Court in Diyarbakir .
the prosecution derives from Section 312 of the penal code used to try several politicians and writers , including Yasar Kemal , in which actions which &quot; openly stir up and incite the population &quot; to animosity and hate by highlighting differences in religion , race , social class or geographical area are prohibited .
Yusuf Akbulut is on trial for having been quoted in the newspaper Huriyet on 3 October 2000 as having welcomed the US Congress recognition of the genocide perpetrated against Armenians in 1915-1918 .
in this context he added the fact that other Christian peoples such as the Assyrians / Syrians were also murdered during the genocide .
for these statements he risks several years of imprisonment .
the trial raises a number of issues ranging from the absurd matter of having such a vague and , with regard to freedom of speech and opinion , unclear paragraph such as Section 312 in the penal code , to the evidence and the background to the case .
we in the Christian Democratic parliamentary Group PPE-DE are following the case .
my third , and final , question to the Commissioner and to the Swedish Presidency is this : are you prepared to carefully monitor the case of Yusuf Akbulut ?
Mr President , Mr Lagendijk once said , and rightly so , that recently , since Helsinki , the gap between the European Union and Turkey has narrowed ; but the problem is that the gap between Turkey and democratic principles , respect for human rights and compliance with international law remains almost as wide as ever .
what we have to achieve is that , as the gap between Turkey and the European Union is reduced , the gap between Turkey and democracy , human rights and international resolutions is reduced proportionally .
the truth , however , is that in recent times things have not been going well in this area in Turkey , where human rights are still being violated .
for example , we know of the letter by Pierre Sané , the secretary of Amnesty International , to the Commission and Council at the end of last year , and also the threats in the last few days to Akin Birdal and the Turkish Human Rights Association , the persistent declarations by the Turkish authorities on the situation of the Kurdish people and the Cyprus conflict , and many other matters .
in adopting the Swoboda report we will for the nth time be sending a positive message to Turkey : look , we in the European Union want our relations to get better and better and for you to be part of our great family , but for this to happen it is essential that you comply with democratic principles .
we have to get this message understood by Ankara , but at the moment they do not want to understand .
the message is a positive response but with this reasoning , with these conditions , with this hope that demonstrable steps will effectively be taken in the immediate future .
I can suggest some , such as freeing our Sakharov prize-winner Leyla Zana , taking a constructive and committed attitude towards Cyprus and the Kurds , and , of course , adopting the essential legal changes to certain laws which date from the military dictatorship and still do not respect human rights .
Mr President , first I would like to thank the rapporteur , Mr Swoboda , for an excellent report , and the same goes to the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , and Common Security and Defence Policy for their realistic presentation of the matter .
the regulation under discussion concerns pre-accession aid to Turkey .
Turkey was accepted as a candidate country at the Helsinki Summit .
for this reason , it would be appropriate if we treated it as we do the other candidate countries .
the EU Financial Perspective includes a Heading 7 covering pre-accession aid .
every year around three billion euros are set aside there - rather more than that , in fact .
in the EU budget , however , pre-accession aid to Turkey , as with Cyprus and Malta also , has been placed under Heading 4 , &quot; External Action &quot; .
these countries are therefore actually accorded a different status from the other candidate countries .
in addition , the same objective , that is to say , pre-accession aid , is being financed now from two different headings , which is blurring the transparency of the budget .
heading 7 , &quot; Pre-accession Aid &quot; , has not been used correctly .
payment appropriations are lagging far behind committed appropriations , and this is thus clearly a case of over-budgeting , which is realised as unspent resources that are returning to the Member States .
however , Heading 4 , &quot; External Action &quot; has become over-burdened .
for two years in succession now - at 200 million euros per year - a flexibility instrument has had to be used to finance it , something which in fact is Parliament &apos; s own disposable fund for unforeseen expenses .
Parliament has thus borne a greater responsibility for EU foreign policy than the Council .
budgeting for pre-accession aid for Turkey , Cyprus and Malta in Heading 4 has increased the over-burdening further and jeopardised the ready availability of these funds .
for that reason I support the proposals in the report to switch these funds to Heading 7 .
Mr President , in my opinion , Turkey has a place in Europe , for both geographical and historical reasons , and no one can stop it from taking its rightful place , along with its culture , history and religion .
that is one issue and it is a separate issue from the Swoboda report , which we are dealing with here , the philosophy behind which is that we should put Turkey , from the point of view of funding mechanisms , on the same basis as the other candidate countries .
this position is wrong for three reasons .
the first reason is because , in Turkey &apos;s case , the Copenhagen criteria have not yet been met . this distinguishes it from the other candidate countries .
the second reason is because we should not discriminate . in the case of Slovakia , in the case of Slovenia , in the case of the Baltic states which failed to apply human rights or had other problems , the integration process , including funding , stopped until they came into line .
just yesterday we were talking with Mr Verheugen about 12-year-old children who are in prison because they belong to the PKK , about Leyla Zana , who received the Sakharov prize and who is in prison .
so let Turkey take a step on the Cyprus issue , on the Kurdish question and on human rights before we go down this line .
Mr President , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , Commissioner , I am sure that everyone here in this Chamber wants a modern , progressive Turkey .
however , to be perfectly honest , I am beginning to wonder if Turkey wants the same thing .
that notwithstanding , the message which we must send out is that , if Turkey joins the European Union , it must adjust to European standards and not the other way round , with the European Union adjusting to Turkish standards .
to be honest , I am not sure if this message has got across - I am referring , Mr President , to the period following the approval of the partnership - and I should simply like to draw the House &apos;s attention to two facts .
first , to what happened in the Turkish jails which was condemned by the European Parliament .
and , secondly , to the hard line stance taken by the Turkish-Cypriot leader Denktash , who is refusing to sit down to inter-community talks and who is being encouraged in this stance by Turkey .
Turkey has obligations on both these issues under the partnership agreement and is choosing to ignore them .
in all events , even if you overlook Turkey &apos;s disdain , so far at least , for its obligations under the partnership agreement , you will be brought up short by Amendment No 1 proposing that Turkey participate in the ISPA and SAPARD programmes .
this amendment is totally unacceptable and I will tell you just two reasons why .
the first reason is that the budget for these programmes has already been decided .
it was decided and agreed in Berlin - Mr Verheugen was personally involved in this agreement as Germany &apos;s Minister of European Affairs and knows all about it - and cannot be increased .
consequently , the only solution would be to cut the share of the other Central and Eastern European candidate countries , such as Poland , Romania , Bulgaria , etc . , which would then receive less money .
the second reason , and this is very important , is that , when it adopted the ISPA and SAPARD programmes , the European Parliament voted against amendments seeking to fund pre-accession tools , Cyprus and Malta from these programmes , on the grounds that Cyprus and Malta were being funded under the ÌÅDA programme .
may I remind the House that Turkey also benefits from the MEDA programme .
what I am wondering , therefore , is why we said no to Cyprus and Malta and are now preparing to say yes to Turkey .
and I say this notwithstanding my immense appreciation for the report by Mr Swoboda , who has done sterling work here in the European Parliament . but that does not prevent me from disagreeing with this specific amendment for the reasons stated , reasons which are of a technical and a political nature .
Mr President , the proposal for a Council regulation on assistance to Turkey under the pre-accession strategy and the report by Mr Swoboda mark yet another significant step towards achieving a great historical objective .
as a matter of fact , Turkey &apos; s economic involvement with the European Union is already high , since more than half of Turkey &apos; s imports come from the Union and more than half of its exports are destined for the European Union .
furthermore , Turkey is a member of NATO , which has a tradition of mutual recognition towards European countries that are members of the alliance .
in addition to other aspects , particularly cultural ones , there are therefore bases on which progress can be made towards Turkey &apos; s future membership of the European Union .
this proposal for a regulation will now enable us to create the necessary legal basis to establish an Accession Partnership , in order to help Turkey fulfil the Copenhagen criteria .
it will do so not only by intensifying the Customs Union , but also by promoting economic and social development , which are essential aspects of an effective partnership .
we therefore support the rapporteur &apos; s proposals that complement the spirit of the Commission &apos; s initiative , particularly those that are designed to ensure that Turkey will benefit from the support provided by the Pre-Accession Structural Instrument and from the Special Programme for Agricultural and Rural Development .
nevertheless , within the development strategy that we are advocating , the path towards economic and social development must go hand in hand with political development , in other words , the exercise of democracy and human rights .
it is in this context that we wish to emphasise and support the content of Article 4 of the proposal for a regulation .
we also feel that by playing a more effective role in this process , the European Parliament can make a contribution and provide certain guarantees .
Mr President , I have a dream . a dream of democratic European cooperation in which Turkey too participates on an equal footing , for Turkey is a part of Europe and has a lot to contribute to European cooperation .
Turkey must make a choice , however : a choice between the future and a past characterised by ethnic oppression , torture , the death penalty and absence of legal security .
I should also like to call upon Turkey and the Commission to make special efforts to reconstruct the villages destroyed by Turkish authorities in eastern Turkey .
I should also like to ask for efforts to be made to help the population to resume their normal lives in these villages .
this might , for example , be via the project developed by , for example , Erik Siesby at the Danish Centre for Kurdish Human Rights , and I know that they have sent details of the project to the Commission .
Mr President , now that the Helsinki European Council has confirmed Turkey &apos;s status as a candidate for accession which must fulfil the same criteria as the other candidate countries , it is logical that Turkey should also benefit from a pre-accession strategy and an Accession Partnership .
the Swoboda report is one outcome of the Helsinki decision and is therefore important .
let me repeat , the issue is not &quot; whether &quot; there should be an Accession Partnership and pre-accession strategy , but &quot; how &quot; .
in one respect , the Swoboda report goes far beyond the Commission &apos;s proposal in that it calls for Turkey to be included in the ISPA and SAPARD financial instruments .
this would have two consequences . firstly , the ISPA and SAPARD financial instruments would have to be cut back , and secondly , the Berlin financial agreement would have to be cancelled .
both are highly unlikely scenarios .
on the other budgetary aspects , I go along with the Swoboda report .
I also think it is important that there should be no discrimination against Turkey .
but SAPARD and ISPA are designed for transformation societies which are evolving from a communist planned economy to what is hopefully a social market economy .
and of course this does not apply to Turkey .
the purpose of the pre-accession strategy and Accession Partnership must be to achieve convergence between Turkey &apos;s political , economic and social conditions and the EU .
it is essential that all candidates for accession are treated equally .
but this does not require any additional resources , e.g. from PHARE , ISPA or SAPARD ; it requires the same procedures as apply to the distribution of PHARE funding .
I therefore call once more for Amendment No 1 of the Swoboda report to be rejected .
Mr President , I will continue where my colleague Mr Stenzel left off .
we had concerns about Turkey &apos;s candidate status , but now it is here , and Turkey therefore also has the right to be included in the financial instruments .
I say this without any ifs and buts .
I welcome the fact that this regulation has now established clarity , especially as the European Union has actually done very little to fulfil its financial commitments towards Turkey since the conclusion of the Customs Union Treaty five years ago .
so this is a fresh start which has our full support .
as far as the two programmes are concerned , I wish I could agree with my colleague Mr Stenzel , but I must also point out that it is not enough for us to view the 177 million already envisaged for the pre-accession strategy as a general framework .
as Mr Kuckelkorn has said , new money , i.e. additional funding , must be made available to Turkey for economic and social cohesion .
this is our common concern , and we therefore support Mr Swoboda &apos;s report in general terms - not in every respect , and not all the proposed amendments , but its general trend .
the regulation includes an Article 4 which allows funding to be suspended under certain circumstances .
this Article 4 is necessary , and it is now up to Turkey to answer all the questions which we have been asking for years , and make progress with regard to a basic democratic structure , the role of the military in the National Security Council , and human and minority right .
to our great regret , I believe that relatively little has been done in these areas in recent months ; on the contrary , we have the impression that the progress initially achieved in the second half of 2000 has now been reversed and that the Turkish side - the government itself - has lost the courage to adopt these measures swiftly and resolutely .
Article 4 is not an instrument which can be used indiscriminately ; it is only intended for the event that very serious shortcomings become evident in the pre-accession process , and I hope that it will not need to be used in the near future .
but one thing must be clear : Turkey &apos;s accession to the European Union can only take place under the conditions set by Europe , not simply on Turkey &apos;s terms .
so far , neither politics nor the government has addressed this misconception held by the Turkish public .
so I would also ask our colleagues on the rostrum to help dispel this misconception at last .
accession will only take place on our terms .
( de ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would first of all like to congratulate Mr Swoboda on his report and to thank Parliament for an extremely constructive and responsible debate . I think you have sent a very positive and also a very clear and unambiguous signal to Turkey .
I believe that , at the end of this debate , we can say that consensus regarding our policy towards Turkey has become much broader .
we agree that the current situation regarding human rights , the protection of minorities and the quality of democracy and the rule of law in Turkey is not what we would wish for .
unfortunately , nothing has changed in that regard .
there is no point glossing over this fact or remaining silent about what is actually happening .
because the situation is as it is , because it is so unsatisfactory , we have endlessly debated what political possibilities we have of changing it .
this brings me to my second point .
we also agree that it is not only in Turkey &apos; s interest but in the interest of Europe as a whole , and especially in the interest of the European Union , to have Turkey as a stable and reliable partner in the long term .
I am sure everyone in this House will agree with me when I say the long-term stability of a state can only be guaranteed if this state is founded on the values we all share , such as democracy , the rule of law , and the protection of minorities .
thirdly , I think we agree that the prospect of membership of the European Union has been the central and most important catalyst for reform ; at least this has been the case throughout the entire history of our enlargement process .
if you look at the countries of Eastern and Central Europe and the tremendous pace of reform they have embarked upon and the enormous success they have had , this has only come about because they had membership in their sights .
the question we must now answer is : can we achieve the same with Turkey ?
in Helsinki we said , yes , we should give it a go .
we are now at a stage where the strategy adopted in Helsinki has become operational and we can therefore actually implement it .
so there is little point in talking today about whether the strategy adopted in Helsinki has changed what is happening on the ground in Turkey or not .
it simply has not .
I would never say it has changed it , but the instruments of this strategy are just not in place .
that is why one cannot say either that it has not had any results .
with what is being discussed here today and what you will subsequently adopt , you are paving the way for the entry into force of the central element of this strategy , namely the accession partnership .
the Accession Partnership sets out our expectations of Turkey .
it lays down what Turkey must do so that we can achieve the result that Turkey fulfils the political and other accession criteria .
once this document has been formally adopted - indeed it has not yet been adopted as we are waiting upon Parliament to express its opinion - we can expect an immediate answer from Turkey .
this document will be the most important document in the history of Euro-Turkish relations over the past few decades .
what I have learned so far leads me to the belief that we are quite possibly on the brink of the most far-reaching political reform in the history of modern Turkey .
that is not to say that today we can discover whether everything that Turkey says to us in its reply will be fully in line with our expectations .
in this respect , Mr Swoboda is quite right when he says that the ball is now in Turkey &apos; s court .
it is really now up to Turkey what steps it takes , what rhythm it adopts and what qualitative efforts it puts into fulfilling the conditions for taking up negotiations on its membership of the European Union .
that is why I underline what a number of speakers have already said .
Turkey is an important country . Turkey is of particular strategic importance .
but that does not mean that , because of Turkey &apos; s strategic importance , the European Union can change its inner character .
that can and must not happen .
it is only right and proper that Turkey wants to join the European Union and not the other way round and that , for that very reason , the accession conditions we have drawn up for all are equally and fully valid for Turkey .
Turkey will not become a member until it has fulfilled these accession conditions to the letter .
neither I nor anybody else knows whether the strategy we adopted in Helsinki , which is fully supported by Parliament , will have the desired effects .
but we have for the first time reached the stage where Turkey must present us with a binding programme and must tell us what it intends to do to change conditions in Turkey .
it will give us the opportunity to bring influence to bear on this programme , because it is a jointly agreed programme , because it is jointly financed by us and because we have the opportunity to influence it and monitor it .
that is why I believe that we have made enormous strides .
as far as the financial and budgetary aspect is concerned , questions have been raised , which I will be pleased to answer .
firstly , all those who say that it would be logical to channel pre-accession aid for Turkey , Malta and Cyprus through the relevant Heading 7 of the Financial Perspective are quite right , as we are clearly dealing with pre-accession aid .
the Commission would like this to happen too .
but I must make it clear that this would not alter in any way the amount of money that was available .
it would simply mean reducing the relevant Heading 4 and increasing Heading 7 , which would not be of much benefit to Malta , Cyprus and Turkey , who naturally want more money .
they do not want us to change the Heading , but more money .
but we do not have more money because the programmes in the Financial Perspective which was adopted in Berlin have been established .
nor are there any budgetary reserves . a Member of this House asked this question .
no , we do not have any budgetary reserves in the pre-accession instruments .
they have all been paid out .
only SAPARD was paid out rather late .
that was because of the regulation for this instrument , but the funds that have been planned for 2000 will be fully paid out during the course of 2001 .
but we do not have any budgetary reserves there .
we could only satisfy the desire , which was expressed by Mr Swoboda and is shared by many of you here , to increase pre-accession aid to Turkey , Malta and Cyprus in order to make the ISPA and SAPARD instruments accessible , by making available more budgetary resources , money which the Commission , at any rate , does not have .
this must be discussed with the Council .
the need may well be there , but I could not , at the moment , accede to the request .
I feel bound to say in all honesty that the Commission would not be able to implement such a resolution because it simply does not have the money .
Mrs Stenzel was quite right to point out that naturally there is a difference between the candidate countries of Eastern and Central Europe , and Turkey , Malta and Cyprus .
the candidate countries of Eastern and Central Europe not only have to adapt to the acquis , they also have to transform their entire economy .
that is , in fact , the political basis for the situation we have today .
may I say finally that , in my estimation , in the year 2000 we set something in motion in Turkey .
we , as politicians , know that the start of a political movement cannot be measured initially in real changes , be it in terms of prisons , NGOs , schools or whatever . no , the start of a political movement can only be measured in the way a society talks about the issues , what issues it talks about and what long-term objectives it sets itself .
in this connection we can very clearly discern in Turkey a massive movement in the year 2000 .
in my opinion , the correct response for the European Union is to support such a political movement and to make the instruments available which we need to bring about tangible concrete results .
I would like to say one last thing . we will not be able to measure the success of our pre-accession strategy towards Turkey by the promises made , i.e. we will not be able to measure it in terms of the editorial content of Turkish newspapers .
but we will be able to measure the success of this strategy in what changes in concrete terms for the Turkish people , whose situations under current conditions are deplorable and in need of radical change .
it will be measured in real structural changes and in real changes to people &apos; s living conditions .
when we see these changes , the time will have come to talk about the next step , but not today .
I am pleased to have discovered such a broad consensus regarding this matter in this Parliament .
I believe that it will help us a great deal if Turkey realises that the Council , Parliament and the Commission have , on this matter , adopted a firm common stance - at least in terms of the basic issues .
our steadfastness in this matter will help us to reach our goals .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to start by wholly echoing the thanks which Commissioner Verheugen addressed to Mr Swoboda for his excellent report on Turkey &apos; s pre-accession aid which has been discussed in this Chamber .
I am convinced that your report , Mr Swoboda , will play a key role in the difficult discussions we are all so involved in , namely how best to bring Turkey closer to the EU .
I asked to speak in order to reply on behalf of the Council to the question which Mr Sacrédeus addressed to the presidency concerning religious freedom and tolerance between religions in Turkey .
let me just say that we in the Council naturally see these issues as being extremely important .
our discussions with Turkey on religious freedom are , of course , based on the fundamental Copenhagen criteria and on what we encounter in the partnership with Turkey concerning fulfilment of the requirements to respect the rights of minorities .
Mr Sacrédeus takes up the important issue of how to stimulate dialogue between different religions in Turkey and generally .
we see this as an important element , not only in the partnership with Turkey but generally in Europe-Mediterranean cooperation .
as far as the Swedish Presidency is concerned , we have tried to build on some of our own experiences .
for example , there is the Euro-Islam project and the conferences against intolerance which were recently held in Stockholm , and of which Mr Sacrédeus is no doubt aware .
we have tried to build on experience from these and to introduce a number of similar ideas into the partnership with Turkey in order to highlight the importance of respect for religious freedom .
Mr Sacrédeus also takes up the important issue of the trial of a Turkish priest .
the Council is monitoring this matter extremely carefully .
we know that the next trial hearing is on 22 February .
the Council will be monitoring what happens then very carefully and we will react in a way we believe is appropriate .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place at 12 noon .
Lisbon
the next item is the joint debate on :
report A5-0034 / 2001 by Mr Bullmann , on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , on the spring 2001 European Council : the Lisbon process and the path to be followed ;
Commission statement - synthesis report on progress since Lisbon and future measures ;
report A5-0020 / 2001 by Mr Gasòliba i Böhm , on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , on the impact of liberalisation and the economic reform process on economic growth in the European Union .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the Lisbon Summit has bequeathed a great heritage . it defined a major task and disseminated a courageous idea : that by the year 2010 Europe will become the most competitive area in the world .
the summit placed its bets on the best Europe has to offer .
it stated that we are on the road towards full employment .
it also made it clear that we want to stake our hopes on the innovative power of the people of the European Union , on their ability to educate and train themselves , to take their destiny into their own hands , and to bring about their own prosperity and that of their families .
this is the strongest productive force that Europe can release .
this central idea logically leads to a political approach which says that economic reform , social involvement , social cohesion and job creation go hand in hand .
they are interacting facets of one and the same process along this path to success , and they must be of mutual support .
they must not be played off against each other .
for many of us this is a challenge to our way of thinking .
many people who have striven their entire lives to achieve a common liberalised market will have to make some mental effort to realise that only social cohesion and employment policies can produce the social productivity which will make the common market a success .
others , who have prided themselves all their lives on the achievements of the Member States , will also have to make some mental effort to realise that the new enlarged common market calls for concerted efforts and new rules to ensure that the process to achieve success can be implemented everywhere .
the Stockholm Summit comes precisely at this decisive moment .
it will decide whether the ambitious goals of Lisbon can be implemented , or whether the citizens of Europe think that we are dealing with nicely worded but empty statements which would have no real impact on political reality .
those who want success in Stockholm must measure and compare how far we have come along the road to success .
above all , they must have the courage to set new ambitious targets so that we can move further along the road to success .
we are told that concrete objectives are difficult to set . of course they are .
but just take a complex issue like inflation rates , which is dependent on many decentralised actors making clever decisions .
on the way to economic and monetary union we clearly managed to introduce a very successful process which has led to success which we would not have believed possible up until a few years ago .
take a complex issue like interest rate trends or the dismantling of excessive national debt .
we have achieved all this with a common effort , and these are all complex matters which call for more than one participant .
if we can achieve all this , then we will surely manage to give every schoolchild in the European Union access to the Internet .
we will be able to set up conditions in which all schoolchildren will not only have access to the Internet but will make decisive progress in the rest of their school curriculum to ensure that , when they enter the European labour market , they will have the opportunities they need .
if we can achieve all this , then we will surely be able to offer every entrepreneur in the European Union a clear , easily comprehensible and simple regulatory framework , which operates in exactly the same way in Spain , Greece , Italy and Germany alike .
if we can achieve all this , then we will surely be able to call upon the strongest productive power in Europe .
we will be able to offer the still more than 14 million unemployed in the European Union real opportunities of taking part in this process of bringing about success .
we still have an employment rate of over 8 % and I would like to draw your attention to a situation which was given short shrift in the debate in the Commission : the fact that we have a youth unemployment rate which is twice as high .
this is a major problem , especially since we are saying here today that we want to make the demographic change manageable , and we want to rely on the intelligence in people &apos; s heads and invest in heads .
much more could be done in practical terms to combat youth unemployment and to invest in the future of Europe .
but for that very reason it is also proper for the Commission , in a preparatory paper in the run-up to Stockholm , to propose that in Stockholm we should look at very specific goals to increase the employment rate to 67 % by 2005 and to strengthen the participation of women in the labour force to 57 % .
these are the right goals to set and we , as the European Parliament , as the representatives of the people of Europe , want to see these goals documented in the final report of the Stockholm Summit .
we think it is important that the people of Europe read about targets which they can readily understand , with which they can identify and in which they can see that their prospects of success in Europe lie .
this will also help us to decide whether there is acceptance of the necessary enlargement of the European Union , which we all want .
but we must also send out a clear signal that all who are currently disadvantaged and who want to contribute their resources will have the opportunity to do so .
whoever wants to must move forward courageously and overcome the rivalries between the European institutions .
the people of Europe do not understand the petty jealousies over the allocation of competences .
it must be made clear that the European Council is assuming its leadership role and that Parliament is taking up its proper place , the place to which it is entitled as the directly elected representative of the people of Europe .
Mr President , Mr Bullmann , Mr Cocilovo , Mr Gasòliba i Böhm , first of all I should like to thank you for the chance Parliament is giving me to debate with you the Lisbon strategy , the system we have established to monitor what was decided there and how it is being put into practice .
last year in Lisbon , the European Union , as Mr Bullmann has pointed out , set itself a goal which meant achieving over the next decade the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world , allowing us to achieve sustainable economic growth with the creation of more jobs and greater social cohesion .
Mr Bullmann has stressed this global vision , a vision that I share absolutely , to which , of course , the Commission &apos; s synthesis report responds .
in this synthesis report the Commission not only tries to define the progress made so far since Lisbon but also what our next goals are .
and Mr Bullmann has stressed this point too .
in Lisbon people said we should set some structural indicators that would enable us to draw a better comparison between the situations in the various countries .
in Nice we defined 35 structural indicators , which are the ones the synthesis report is based upon .
there is no doubt at all that they are useful tools for seeing the progress that has been made , the concrete objectives defined and the timetables for achieving them .
they are also a reference for the progress we can make in the next few years .
it is true that in the way we designed them these indicators are not solely for use in the synthesis report ; they will also be used in other Commission reports , such as the report on the implementation or fulfilment of the obligations resulting from setting the Broad Economic Policy Guidelines in motion .
the report - I am not going to repeat it - highlights what we consider to be the positive progress achieved during this period .
there are clearly some elements , such as the progress made on certain liberalisations , that are without any doubt clearly positive .
in other cases things are moving too slowly .
in any case , the synthesis report highlights the good performance of the economy , the growth achieved last year and that expected next year , and the creation of 2.5 million jobs , which is , without any doubt , a fundamental point .
in any case , the synthesis report aims to stress that the Lisbon objective is a global objective , as Mr Bullmann has pointed out .
we must not just think exclusively about growth and forget about the other aspects of Lisbon .
there is no doubt that macro-economic growth and stability are fundamental elements , but employment and social cohesion are too .
we have included in the synthesis report , as Mr Bullmann has mentioned , a series of specific proposals , ten priorities that the Commission would like to see approved at the Stockholm European Council , so that they will enable us to make progress in strengthening our commitments to structural and social change , which is fundamental for the sustainable economic growth that will enable us to reduce unemployment and improve cohesion .
as the Commissioner responsible for Economic and Financial Affairs I should like to say a little more about three points that I think are relevant : first of all , the maintenance and strengthening of a stable macro-economic framework .
in addition to the objective already mentioned of achieving a knowledge-based society with better jobs , I believe it is important to achieve a stable environment allowing us to achieve the objectives of price stability and healthy public finances in the medium term .
in the current favourable economic climate , despite the slowing of American growth , I believe we have to continue the processes of fiscal consolidation and improving the quality and sustainability of public finances , taking into account aspects as important as the ageing of the population , for instance .
when I say quality , I mean especially a fiscal policy aimed more towards creating jobs , supporting research and innovation , and increasing investment in human resources .
when I say sustainability of public finances I mean the ability to meet future obligations .
the second of my concerns is that we have to strengthen the potential growth of the Union .
it is a fact that good progress has been made on the reforms needed so that we can maintain a model of permanent growth .
yet in this period of economic boom we have a unique opportunity to improve the internal market for services and achieve greater openings in sectors such as energy , transport and others that benefit the consumer .
we are aware , of course , that any liberalisation process has to be accompanied at the same time by a regulation control plan , which in the end will allow us to achieve positive effects without a negative impact on society .
my last comment refers to job creation and a rise in the activity rate : we must remember that two thirds of the difference between the gross domestic product levels of the United States and the European Union is due precisely to the different use of the work factor .
it is therefore absolutely fundamental to set in motion all the necessary fiscal and social reforms , including early retirement , pension plans or labour regulations , which will enable us to improve this situation .
also fundamental are elements like education and training , business incentives and also public investment , essential for job quality .
all this should enable us Europeans to make progress along the line defined in Lisbon , which we all want to be consolidated in Stockholm .
the reports we are dealing with here , the Bullmann report and the Gasòliba i Böhm report , include a large number of suggestions that are very close to the content of the synthesis report .
my idea is to take into consideration all these references and indications , some of which refer to specific indicators , and analyse them to see to what extent some of the elements put forward can be incorporated in our future reports .
Parliament is right when it points out that for the Lisbon strategy to be successful it is absolutely essential to have the commitment of all the players involved in the process .
from this viewpoint the two reports presented to the House today are without any doubt basic elements and a clear expression of Parliament &apos; s commitment to cooperate in the Lisbon process , which - as I said earlier - we hope will continue and improve with the decisions made in Stockholm .
Mr President , Commissioner , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , ladies and gentlemen , last year &apos; s Lisbon European Council established a process for the European Union to reach the same level of competitiveness as the United States , or at least for us to achieve this level by 2010 .
I believe that both Mr Bullmann &apos; s report and my own make a positive and constructive contribution to our thinking on how to achieve this goal and our ability to take stock and analyse the situation after the past year , before the Stockholm European Council .
the strategic goal of the European Union economy is to turn itself into the most dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world capable of sustainable growth with more and better jobs and greater social cohesion .
all these objectives are highly demanding .
the European Union will not give up its level of social cohesion as an economy based on well-being , which is one of the great features of European society , achieved and consolidated during the second half of the last century .
at the same time it is a clearly dynamic economy , as it has been demonstrating over these last years .
but nobody can fail to see that having such strong social commitments , ensuring sustainable growth and also being the most competitive economy in the world are three highly demanding objectives , and to meet them we must therefore keep well on top of any possible obstacles to achieving this .
in my view , something that may jeopardise the joint achievement of these three objectives is if the basic factors that ensure the competitiveness of the European economy are not implemented rigorously enough . I believe there are basically three of these factors .
first of all , there are some markets that are still not open enough to competition , and given that they are basic to our production structure they have a negative effect on cost structures , including unit prices for goods and services .
Mr Solbes has mentioned them : energy , transport and telecommunications .
they are obviously fundamental factors , and if we compare them with the other leading world economy , the United States , we still have a gap to make up , clearly preventing us from approaching this desired level of competitiveness which we have set for 2010 .
in second place is a subject that concerns me greatly and is very well expressed both in the Bullmann report and my own : employment .
it is obvious that we cannot give up the idea of raising employment levels , which is one of the major goals set by the Swedish Presidency .
but it is also obvious that to achieve this level of employment - and as both reports point out , with a more highly qualified labour force - we have to find a greater willingness to adapt , both socially - there are countries within the European Union that have very interesting formulas in this respect - and , as the 1995 Delors report said , in the sphere of labour market flexibility .
this is an essential factor in achieving two objectives , that is , a higher employment rate and greater competitiveness throughout the productive structure , where of course the labour dimension is fundamental .
lastly , education .
I shall not labour this point , since the Bullmann report has mentioned it , as has Commissioner Solbes .
this third essential element is that of quality education at all levels , from occupational training to specialist studies in higher education .
this must lay the foundations - I am finishing here , Mr President - for us to get what we really need , something that Europe has not yet achieved in comparison with the United States .
although we have a very high level of scientific training and scientific innovation , we still have not closed the gap on the United States , nor have we overcome the existing difference to achieve a kind of technological development that can be turned into competitive goods and services .
this is the third fundamental recommendation in this analysis and stock-taking of the Lisbon European Council .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , it is with great interest that I take part in the debate on Mr Bullmann &apos; s report on the preparations ahead of the Stockholm European Council and on the report from Mr Gasòliba i Böhm on the significance of deregulation and economic reforms on economic growth in the European Union .
full employment must constitute a fundamental aim for EU economic and social policy .
the strategy adopted in Lisbon is an important milestone in the development of the EU .
with regard to the employment targets in the Lisbon strategy , the Council agrees with the Bullmann report &apos; s proposal for intermediate targets .
we hope that the Council will be able to decide on this in Stockholm .
today &apos; s Europe is better equipped than it has been for a long time to extend the opportunity to work to everyone who wants to , and is able to , work .
the outlook for the European economy is still good .
public finances are strong .
prices are stable .
reforms of the product and capital markets are well underway across Europe .
however , there is no room for complacency , as 14 million people in Europe are still out of work .
unemployment is a massive waste of economic resources and - what is worse - of people &apos; s skills and ambitions .
having a job means the chance of providing for oneself and , in the long term , is the best way to achieve a society in which everyone can feel they are taking part .
the Stockholm European Council on 23-24 March will be the first in a series of spring summits aimed at encouraging development towards the strategic aims established in Lisbon .
in Stockholm we should openly and critically assess the progress made in the last year .
we intend to move the work forward both through Community legislation and what is known as the new open method of coordination .
the Swedish Presidency will work on not letting the Lisbon strategy be derailed by adding too many new issues .
nor do we need any new processes .
instead , the Stockholm European Council should highlight certain prioritised areas .
full employment and increased competitiveness will be achieved through economic reform and open and functioning markets , combined with a healthy macro-economic policy which stimulates growth and employment .
I was interested in what the report from Mr Gasòliba i Böhm had to say on economic reform and growth and agree that the role a policy on economic reform has to play in growth and employment must not be underestimated .
however , I would like to stress that economic reform must take place in conjunction with investment in training , a modernised social security system and improved welfare .
this also requires a commercial climate which facilitates investment and the establishment of new growth companies .
I want us in Stockholm to highlight the directions for further progress in these areas .
let me name a few .
in Stockholm we expect to be able to establish the timetable for liberalisation of the electricity and gas markets .
we aim to push on with reform of the financial markets , with regard to which the important Lamfalussy report will provide the foundation for discussions in Stockholm .
furthermore , we need to continue work on opening up the transport markets .
however , opening up the product and capital markets is not an end in itself .
instead , there are two reasons for this action : it is a tool for growth and increased employment .
it is also a tool for increased consumer benefit - lower prices and a greater range and better quality of goods and services .
in this context , we are also aware that external trade policy has a role to play , and we hope to be able to shed light on this issue too in Stockholm .
the Stockholm Summit should also emphasise the significance of new technology by developing the action plan for e-Europe and removing obstacles to the growth of biotechnology and its significance for innovation and growth .
however , we must also take into account the moral and ethical dimension of biotechnology .
expected demographic development in Europe poses a growing challenge .
low birth rates and an increasing proportion of older people threatens to considerably increase the maintenance burden for people of working age from around 2010 onwards .
demographic development must be tackled on a broad political front right now .
this will require an extensive review of pension systems and systems for health care and care of the elderly .
it will also require measures to increase participation in the labour market .
the significance of improved conditions for families with children , increased equality and lifelong learning should be highlighted more clearly as means of meeting the demographic challenges .
as more people take up employment , the focus on working conditions increases .
the aim in Stockholm is to be able to agree on a definition of the concept of quality at work and its significance for growth and employment .
I would also like to stress the vital importance which the successful development of economic and monetary union has for stability and welfare in Europe .
the Swedish Presidency will be actively working to ensure that the introduction of notes and coins in euros in the currency union at the start of 2002 is an unqualified success .
this is in the interests of us all .
Mr President , I do not know how convincing I can be in just four minutes .
however , I shall at least try to make my position clear on some aspects of this report which have concerned Parliament in reaction to the Commission &apos; s initiative and the commitments announced by the Council .
other Members have effectively summed up the most significant results of the Lisbon Summit already .
the goal of full employment is once again proposed as the object of common attention and common commitment .
we all know it will not be achieved tomorrow , but we declare it achievable under certain conditions .
we have found a new determination to build the most open and competitive economic area in Europe based on the information and knowledge society , and updating the package of operational instruments which accompany that effort .
but above all , we have asserted that these results can be achieved without adding a fourth process to the existing ones , through a solid combination of policies .
there needs to be a complementary approach in economic policy , employment policy and social policy , and of course the policies being associated and combined to achieve the objectives must be compatible in terms of internal consistency .
finally , the special spring European Council provides a clear opportunity for everyone to take stock of progress made and of the effective implementation of the processes and decisions which have been taken , noting any successes and any delays , through the open method of coordination .
I would like to talk about that for a moment , because open coordination is certainly different from superimposing Community policies and guidelines on the policies of the national states and societies that operate within that framework , but it is also something more than empty coordination .
open coordination cannot be a magic formula , nor can it be an empty declaration , and it should mobilise public opinion in support of a European project that guarantees transparency and effective opportunities for verification .
it is not acceptable for the stability pact and convergence parameters to be backed by instruments and offices for checking , measuring and , where necessary , censure .
that would disarm our advocacy , however prophetic , of the virtues of the European economic and social model .
instead , comparable data should be made available , together with a rigorous social glossary which would make it impossible to go on using the same words with different meanings , as has sometimes happened , but , most of all - which is worse - to go on using the same words and doing different things .
hence the importance of the proposal on indicators to stop us constantly changing policies to maintain the scientific phenomenon of perpetual motion , that strange experiment which keeps a process moving while at the same time preventing it from reaching any goal .
Mr President , I should like to congratulate Mr Bullmann on having produced a report which manages to keep consistently to the main point and address all the consequences of the very important resolutions passed in Lisbon .
the rapporteur proposes a dynamic combination of measures based on a complementary perception of economic reform , employment and social policy , illustrating the added benefits for each of these sectors .
we can only hope that future follow-ups to Lisbon will apply the same policy and demonstrate the same soundness of judgment and consistency .
I should like to comment , in particular , on the importance of the knowledge economy and of investments in human resources as a basic element of European policy .
lifelong learning is a prime means for the European economy of developing the human capital which a knowledge society needs at its disposal .
we need more educated , suitably trained workers in all leading-edge sectors .
lifelong learning is not a new philosophy ; it is a serious political proposal to allow human resources to adapt and evolve in the face of new developments .
we also need to ensure that suitable information networks are created , to which all citizens have access , without exclusion and without a cost barrier .
all current obstacles to lifelong learning should be dealt with and removed .
this is a social cost which we need to bear in the belief that it will yield a maximum return , for the benefit of the European social and political model .
another important point which I should like to highlight is the free movement of students , teachers , instructors and researchers , in order to strengthen the role of education in the nascent knowledge-based European society .
however , measures must also be taken to avoid the obvious danger of information poverty .
care must be taken to ensure that labour market flexibility does not lead to new forms of insecurity and marginalisation for workers .
in today &apos;s era of globalisation and huge technological changes in everyday life , citizens need to be given more opportunity to adapt and evolve and additional cultural choices .
we need to strengthen culture in general in Europe and the cultural environment which is directly linked to the economic and social situation .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , we are living in an age of globalisation and digitalisation , and we talk about a knowledge-based society .
the whole of our society , our economic life , is on the threshold of major structural changes .
what we have become used to is disappearing ; things are changing .
a policy to establish a regulatory framework is now more pressing than ever .
the European Union has set itself the ambitious target of becoming the most dynamic economic region in the world by 2010 .
to this end , a number of conditions need to be met and we need to do our homework .
the policy on training has already been addressed on a number of occasions .
the resource Europe has is knowledge .
this is where we must invest in our young people , in particular .
we talk about new technologies such as the Internet .
but we also need to talk about equipping people with new ways of thinking .
my generation and the generation before that did not concern itself very much with the idea of being independent or becoming an entrepreneur .
I think in future we should make young people in school more aware of this idea so that it becomes quite natural for them to embark upon an independent life .
but we also need to talk about flexibility in our labour markets .
I fully concur with Mr Bullmann , when he talks of targets , but we are constantly experiencing just how little targets match up with concrete actions .
we are all in agreement on the objective of making labour more flexible .
but if we take a look at Germany and the new Industrial Constitution Act , then we realise that targets and actions do not always tally , which makes it all the more difficult simply to orient policies towards targets .
we also need to make more effort in the area of high technology .
the Internet has been mentioned .
access to the Internet in Europe is still too expensive .
its use in comparison with other countries is still too limited .
our approach to new technologies , such as biotechnology , needs to be more aggressive and more optimistic .
but we should not restrict our investments to new technologies .
we should also consider how to bridge the gap between the new economy and the old economy .
I am fundamentally opposed to this demarcation .
in Bavaria there is a carpenter who already achieves 70 % of his sales via the Internet .
if I may ask the experts here , does he belong to the old economy or to the new economy ?
I think he simply belongs to the economy .
we need to bring them together and make them viable .
but - and I would like to warmly congratulate Mr Gasòliba i Böhm on his report on deregulation - we need to become competitive . we need to make our structures competitive .
we have had very positive experiences when it comes to air transport , telecommunications and energy , and other markets such as transport , gas , the postal services and finances are also being considered .
ultimately though , our goal must be to have competition only where it benefits the consumer .
I would like to offer a word of warning that not every sector should be deregulated straight away just for the sake of positive competitiveness .
an example is water .
water is a limited resource .
we certainly cannot abandon the water market in Europe , with its high quality standard , to the vagaries of competition overnight in a sector specific or even case specific way .
in this connection I support the issue of limiting competition - of limiting general European competition law to local and regional public services .
social structures and evolved structures are a form of capital for Europe : good training , good health , social tranquillity .
we should not maintain structures just for the sake of maintaining them , we must develop them further ; they can incorporate competitive elements .
we can make them more effective and structure them positively .
but we must not abandon political responsibility .
it is a difficult balancing act .
we will raise this issue again later in the year in the liberalisation debates in this House .
but I think it must be possible to combine competition , subsidiarity and political answerability on the ground .
I believe this is the route Europe must take to become more competitive and yet maintain cohesion .
Mr President , it is sometimes said in the debate in my home country that the EU cannot be changed , but I think that the political agenda we are now discussing shows that change can be made .
in 1995 , when I was new to this Parliament , we almost exclusively discussed stabilisation policy .
this area remains , but stabilisation policy has been supplemented by issues regarding growth , employment and social welfare .
a changed reality has made this possible , but it is also a matter of political priorities .
this has come about via Amsterdam and Lisbon and is now continuing in Stockholm .
it is sometimes said that the issues which we are now addressing - issues of employment and social welfare - are exclusively national .
yes , to a large extent they are local , regional and national issues .
however , by setting out targets for meeting common challenges in the future , we create added value through a European policy .
we do this partly through straightforward legislation in areas such as the work environment and labour law and partly through the open coordination method , which means establishing common targets for various matters .
the process of monetary union and targets for inflation , interest rate development and budget deficits have proven the success of the approach .
now we are doing the same thing for employment levels , exclusion and demographic issues .
the Lisbon process comprises three parts : economic policy , employment policy and social policy / social cohesion .
it is important that there be a balance between these three areas , which are all vital to the process .
I would like to thank rapporteur Bullmann for highlighting , in his report , this balance and the importance of maintaining it .
I would like to emphasise two points in particular : education policy in a knowledge-based society , which is incredibly important , and , as I have said , the significance of tackling the challenges with regard to demographic development right now .
in Stockholm we need to focus , as we cannot manage everything at once .
so let us focus on certain important issues so as to set the process in motion .
indicators are not an end in themselves , but simply a means of achieving established targets .
I would also like to emphasise the role of Parliament .
we have a role in legislation , but we have no clear role in the issue of the open coordination method .
as this becomes increasingly important , we must have an Institutional Agreement in which the role of Parliament is strengthened .
however , one ingredient is missing - we mention it in our report and hope that the Gothenburg Summit will address the same aspect - and that is also to link the ecological aspects to this process and to these issues .
Mr President , the Lisbon European Council gave a clear message to the people of Europe : Europe is to become the most competitive economy in the world .
this is the right ambition to have and must now be followed up effectively in Stockholm .
however , it must not be the same as so many other EU documents - words without concrete results .
we now need firm proposals .
the 14 million unemployed have had enough of grand resolutions .
I must admit that we Liberals are taking a rather guarded approach until we see the results of the Stockholm European Council .
I would like to stress that Mr Bullmann has done a good job , but the report has become too wide in its scope and the large number of proposals has meant a loss of focus .
we would have preferred a more concentrated approach and a clear list of priorities .
we fully support the Commission &apos; s criticism of the slow speed of reform in Europe .
in this context the Council deserves the most criticism , but Parliament is also at fault .
allow me to highlight a few important measures aimed at getting Europe moving : there needs to be further liberalisation of the energy markets , and the post and telecommunications sector - an area in which Mr Danielsson can act on his strengths .
other issues include reduced taxes , particularly on work , better conditions for small and medium-sized businesses and a more flexible labour market .
in addition , we need to create a common financial market - an area in which very little has happened so far - and a connected e-Europe .
biotechnology must also be stimulated .
a more liberal Europe means a Europe with greater cohesion and greater social security , which means that people &apos; s willingness to take risks and dare to try new things increases .
Europe needs a policy in which jobs are created and citizens can choose their own future .
it is a good idea to set out targets and constantly monitor progress and have relevant statistical indicators , but this never replaces concrete proposals .
as a Swede , I hope that the Stockholm European Council will be a watershed , where decisions will be taken which pave the way for a competitive and liberal Europe .
finally , I would like to say to Mr Danielsson that a dynamic Europe also requires a common currency .
do not forget that .
more and more people are wondering when Sweden will fulfil its commitments .
Mr President , Commissioner , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , my speech will concentrate on the Commission report on the Lisbon European Council .
I believe that it is an interesting report and the comments that I shall make are intended to suggest a few improvements to the Commission .
it is what is called constructive criticism .
my first point concerns the content of the report .
I am extremely surprised that no reference is made to the marked disparities between countries and regions of the European Community with regard to the information society .
it is a fact that the European Union is made up of geographical subdivisions which differ greatly from one another .
the situation of the Scandinavian countries is quite different from that of the countries of southern Europe , and account should be taken of this in order to refine this analysis .
my second point is that the Commission quite rightly talks of an integrated response .
I would like to make some suggestions regarding three broad areas to make this integration operate more smoothly .
first of all , with regard to sustainable development , it is vital that the Commission recognise that the Lisbon process lacks an environmental dimension .
we must ensure that the Gothenburg report rearranges the order of Lisbon &apos; s priorities .
to give a practical example of this , in terms of energy and transport , it is not sufficient to say that liberalisation will enable us to lower prices , and , consequently , consumers and businesses will have greater access .
we also need indicators showing the increase in public transport or the growth of truck-on-train technology .
the issue of indicators will emerge and that is why we tabled a number of amendments to the Bullmann report .
similarly , it is not enough for the Commission to say that it has made a statement on services of general interest .
Parliament is currently considering this issue .
initiatives must be taken to limit the extent to which competition is introduced into various sectors .
secondly , there is the role of education and training .
you start off by making a fundamental observation about the general lack of training .
the Commission should look into two issues more closely .
on the one hand , the issue of balancing work , training and leisure time .
why not have a framework directive , or at least a Commission recommendation , to enable workers and citizens in general to benefit from the different patterns of training , work and leisure ?
on the other hand , there is the issue of public and private funding of this training , the problem of the responsibility of businesses , including for the training of their workers , which raises the question whether public money is well spent .
thirdly , I believe that it would be a good idea if the Commission statement followed the example of the report on economic and social cohesion , in which Mr Barnier discussed European Union enlargement .
clearly , many of the priorities set out in the Commission statement should be reworded , in view of the European Union &apos; s enlargement , for example , with regard to the labour market - where issues such as health and safety will become fundamental - social exclusion and social protection .
this cannot be related to the issue of an ageing population , but simply to the creation of a whole new branch of social security , as the latest report from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development has just reminded us once again .
these are a few suggestions , Commissioner .
I hope that they will be taken into consideration in the Commission &apos; s next reports , particularly with regard to integration , sustainable development and the knowledge-based society .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , what is the path to be followed after Lisbon ?
I would like to give my response in terms of the content , our responsibilities and the method .
first of all , I believe that we cannot regard the European Union &apos; s strategy on sustainable development , full employment and greater social cohesion as set in stone .
the Lisbon process has many virtues and its objectives are extremely ambitious and well founded .
it has a comprehensive and open method of coordination and reflects a clear understanding of the challenges of the information revolution .
however , it still contains many areas of bias .
the current framework to monetary , budgetary and financial policies encourages fiscal and social competition ; the ability to carry out public policies is still compromised on a national level and is totally obstructed on a European level .
I would say that this is negative integration , in the sense that Tinbergen intended , and it is not wholly positive integration .
these areas of bias are obvious in the current problem regarding indicators .
there are comparable indicators at a national level , which are useful , but there are no European-level indicators to enable us to rank Europe &apos; s position in the global economy and to apply common policies .
moreover , we do not study the impact that the choices made by one or more countries have on other countries .
why is Ireland being criticised ?
is it for its policy of public spending in favour of growth or actually for its anti-Community social dumping policy ?
I understand why Mr Bullmann says that growth is actually taking place but that we must not rest on our laurels .
in this respect , it is disturbing that the Council and Commission do not evaluate the social and economic impact of the large , integrated financial market or that of the launch of the euro .
that is why we should consider Lisbon to be more of a beginning than an achievement ; we must work on ironing out these contradictions and , sooner or later , we will have to change this strategy in order to make progress .
Mr Goebbels and Mr Bullmann have , moreover , tabled a good amendment to enable us to do this .
secondly , the European Parliament should be able to make straightforward choices .
in my opinion , the two reports , for which the committees voted unanimously , contradict one another .
I support the Bullmann report , which recommends public investment and social legislation .
however , I cannot support the report by Mr Gasòliba i Böhm which concentrates on deregulation and flexibility alone .
I would like to stress , moreover , that if the internal market does not reach its goal in terms of essential services such as energy and transport , it is not due to deregulation , but because of a lack of infrastructure and common public regulations .
I would also like to say that I disagree with the endless reduction in social security contributions , which is still being called for , which absolves businesses of any responsibility and creates poor workers .
thirdly , and finally , we should indeed help every European social and civil operator to make a choice in terms of economic and social policy .
yet , people are not familiar with these methods of coordination .
they have absolutely no idea what they entail .
we should , therefore , give thought to our responsibilities .
I believe that we could take up this proposal again , in order to attract the attention of the citizens .
Mr President , it is difficult to disagree overall with what Mr Bullmann and Mr Gasòliba i Böhm propose . apart from anything else , their proposals would at least mean greater transparency .
what is hard to understand is not their work , but why , supporting the outcome of the Lisbon Council , the Union is sometimes out of line with the principles it stands for .
as we know , the 15 Member States do not have a common economic policy so much as a group of Community guidelines , laws and prohibitions .
faced with the challenge of globalisation , there must be more effort to give the Union common arrangements and policies based on a common history and culture , and every country must adopt a competitive flexibility .
but it is not unusual for both to be harnessed only for purposes of economic growth and not for social progress .
in some cases , public administration needs to be reformed , but in others there is also a need , for the purposes of wealth production , for the individual Member States to reform developing sectors and realise their potential in terms of basic criteria through their infrastructure policy , and move towards a policy of wealth redistribution .
yet faced with the growth of insecurity and poverty , there does not seem to be anything else to do at national and Community level except represent it statistically as accurately as possible .
liberalisation enters into these considerations too , because , while we support it in terms of theoretical benefit to the final consumer , in practice it is not reflected in quality , safety or universal enjoyment .
so roll on greater coordination of Community policies and better indicators to demonstrate their effectiveness .
but it remains desirable that the Union should not only determine its future arrangements rapidly but should also make the principles it repeatedly proclaims increasingly applicable , binding and consistent .
yesterday , Alan Greenspan told us that the United States economy will only grow by 2.5 % in 2001 and unemployment will rise by 0.5 % , from 4 % to 4.5 % .
those are the statistics of a dynamic and competitive economy .
for us , those statistics would represent a boom in economic growth , while the United States economy is considered to be in recession .
I appreciate the work done by Mr Bullmann and Mr Gasòliba i Böhm - in particular I fully support the Gasòliba report - but I think that it may amount to too little because Parliament is given too little to discuss and propose .
for example , the Bullmann report talks about modernising the pension systems , a subject also mentioned by Commissioner Solbes .
in Europe , we are irresponsibly consuming the national insurance contributions of young people .
what are they going to get , 20 or 40 years from now , in return for the high contributions they have to pay today ?
reforms are needed , either of the parameters by raising the minimum pensionable age , or of the system by - as I believe would be appropriate - changing to a capitalisation system for compulsory national insurance , and not - that would be the last straw - just for supplementary national insurance .
in the dynamic economy dominating the world today - the United States &apos; economy - there is concern about social security deficits which will begin to show up in 2025 and will have used up the accumulated capital reserves only in 2037 .
in Europe and in many European countries - I am particularly thinking of my own country , Italy - we are irresponsibly heading for disaster in the social security accounts .
in Europe , we have no way of defeating the corporate resistance of those - I am thinking primarily of the trade unions - championing pensioners and people retiring on the backs of young workers - the lucky ones - and young jobless , supported by the very high national insurance contributions which depress employment .
I am very much in favour Tony Blair &apos; s proposal for a Europe where people can work after the age of 65 , because I come from a country where people retire at 55 and even younger , and their pensions are paid for by the contributions of younger workers .
in conclusion , Mr President , let us talk less about goals we all agree on - who would not want Europe to be a dynamic economy ? - and a bit more about the choices , some of them painful and difficult , which need to be made as soon as possible .
Mr President , following the launch of economic and monetary union two years ago , there would indeed appear to be great resistance to the coordination of economic policy .
it seems an almost impossible feat to get 12 different economies with divergent economic situations to sing from the same hymn sheet .
the fact is that the Member States accepted monetary union reluctantly , but are not about to sacrifice even more policy freedom in order to achieve the real convergence required .
the socio-economic performance indicators proposed by the Commission represent an attempt to bring about a form of socio-economic coordination nonetheless , without having to go through a legislative procedure bristling with pitfalls .
it is far from ideal , but better some of a pudding than none of a pie , you might say .
given this political reality , it is very foolish to nip this convergence process in the bud by proposing a confusing mass of indicators .
the business community is already complaining of fact-finding overload .
the national statistical offices simply do not have the resources or manpower for the job .
and to saddle Eurostat with it would be putting the cart before the horse .
the 27 indicators proposed by the Commission is on the excessive side as it is .
we should start with around ten and then increase the number carefully , and where there is a pressing need to do so .
it is a shame that the Bullmann report is sending the convergence process into the wilderness in its tender youth .
I hope that the Commissioner will shortly explain in clear and specific terms to what extent , and in what kind of timeframe , the far-reaching proposals from the motion for a resolution can be put into practice .
in any case , statistics do not tell the whole story .
they provide a snapshot of reality .
after all , we do not say that the United States has the greatest sporting prowess because they won the most medals at the Olympic Games .
you only have to divide the number of medals per head of population for the US to drop like a stone down the international league table , and for most European countries to emerge with better sporting achievements than the United States .
and of course Belgium has long been renowned for its skating prowess .
in short , indicators are a means of steering policy but not an end in themselves .
I would just like to say that , broadly speaking , my group is able to support Mr Gasòliba &apos; s report , although , unfortunately , it devotes far too little attention to the drawbacks attending liberalisation .
. ( de ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , we have all set ourselves the ambitious target of turning Europe into the most modern and most attractive economic region in the world for enterprises and workers .
as is so often the case , there is conflict not about the target , but about how to achieve this target .
some people believe that this target will be achieved through completely free entrepreneurial activity : others through controlling and regulating turbo capitalism .
of course , the truth lies in coming up with an intelligent combination of the two approaches .
to make our economic area the most attractive in the world , our economy needs to be highly efficient . at the same time it needs to be human driven and take the form of a social market economy .
Mr Bullmann has given us a lot of definitions of important structural indicators , which are intended to give us pointers for the correct approach to take .
this in fact gives rise to the problem of increased burdens on medium-sized enterprises .
that is why we support the proposal made by the Group of the Europe Liberal , Democratic and Reform Party that new statistics must not mean that medium-sized enterprises will have to shoulder a greater burden ; existing material must be resorted to .
too much knowledge leads to all too frequent interventions , and this could blacken the prospects for the economy .
the problem for the future consists in doing the right thing with the data and new facts at our disposal .
it is therefore about fostering competition between systems , and private involvement .
at the same time we also need rules to make sure that our systems are competitive .
a look at my country is enough to show what should not be done : the extension of codecision in Germany .
in my country it is argued that , because of the dynamics of the economy , more works councils should be set up which , for practical purposes , means for all medium-sized enterprises .
just imagine it if you can : new works councils are to be set up not only for large enterprises , but also for medium-sized enterprises . now , that is nonsense .
not even the Bullmann report would argue to that effect , and rightly so .
there is everything in there , from the development of research to pension regulations , but thankfully he does not say anything about extending codecision .
by sticking with this concept , the red-green coalition in Germany is treading a misguided path , which is neither covered nor called for by European analyses .
so , on this point , Germany , the biggest country in Europe , is showing itself to be incapable of meeting the new challenges as the most attractive economic area in the world .
no , the red-green coalition is doing this aspect of the European challenge a real disservice .
the token gesture that has been made to the trades unions in Germany because their influence is decreasing , is a poisoned chalice .
many in our group fear that the report before us contains too much detailed knowledge and detailed analyses .
we must take this problem into consideration .
the basic message that the European globalised world and the Europeans in this globalised world must take with them is that , above all , our economy must remain competitive and must not be restricted by this report .
however , what we also need - which is missing in the report - is the next phase of the analysis .
we need more global rules for global competition .
Mr President , the new European strategy which came out of Lisbon for a competitive , dynamic and knowledge-based Europe stood the test of time in the year 2000 and so , with the help of the synthesis report and the resolutions adopted at Stockholm , it must be further consolidated within the main thrusts of economic policy , which must be more binding this year than they have been in previous years .
unemployment has finally fallen , even though the still high level of unemployment is deplorable .
nevertheless , 2.6 million new jobs have been created and the positive economic trends have been confirmed by good economic data , even though the pace has slowed down .
the strategic approach of giving equal status to the policy areas of economic reform , economic growth , full employment and social inclusion has proved its worth .
but it must be consolidated and implemented .
the US economic climate , however , is keeping Europe on tenterhooks .
but a soft landing does seem possible .
nevertheless , Europe must be prepared for lower demand for its exports .
for that reason , there is no alternative but to introduce structural reforms in the goods , services , capital and labour markets , which must lead to increased output potential and productivity .
Mr Friedrich , extended codecision can even lead to higher motivation among the workforce and thus to increased productivity .
the European Union has made great strides in terms of structural reforms , which is underlined by the most recent progress report of the International Monetary Fund on the euro zone .
this is also true for information and communications technologies and for the labour markets .
at the same time a policy mix must be developed which will help compensate for the effects of a possibly negative impact on the EU internal market from reduced US demand , by increasing domestic demand .
the Bullmann report and the synthesis report , with its ten correctly identified fields of action , rightly emphasise that the future of Europe lies in the ability of Member States to reform themselves , in the qualifications offensive aimed at increasing employment , in the modernisation of infrastructures , the expansion of the information society and in overcoming poverty and social exclusion .
to this end , the instruments of privatisation and deregulation must be exploited to the full .
but new instruments must only be used where restructuring and , hence , regulation are needed .
especially important is a clear regulatory framework in all areas , most notably for financial services , which have a high priority for increased investment activity , which is crucial in the EU .
this is in the interest of the European model of a social market economy .
it is also important that the open coordination process method is taken a step further .
in this connection , a timetable , together with qualitative and quantitative objects , as well as intermediate goals , are needed .
this proved to be crucial with the advent of the internal market and the introduction of economic and monetary union .
in this case too , it must lead to the streamlining of the domestic market in the interest of the economy and employment .
to this end , the European Parliament needs to play an enhanced role and be more involved in the process of coordinating economic policy .
the Swedish Presidency has called for democracy and transparency in this area .
I hope they are as good as their word .
Mr President , I would like to congratulate the Commission on its synthesis report and on keeping up the pressure on the Council and this House to deliver the promises made in the Lisbon process .
however , I would like to address one specific issue where the Commission and indeed all of us are rather weak : that is the issue of regulatory burdens .
we need to be a little better informed about the kind of regulatory burdens which we might be creating wittingly or , more importantly , unwittingly in the legislation that we pass .
I see in the Commission &apos;s synthesis report no more than four or five paragraphs on this very important issue .
regulatory burdens and the reduction of regulatory burdens is a subject which is thick with rhetoric and clichés , but rather thin on action and practicality .
it means that as legislators in the European Parliament we are often legislating blind .
we often deal with proposals that come from the European Commission which do not have proper impact assessments attached to them .
we then table amendments when we do not know what the effect of those amendments will be .
that is clearly an inappropriate way in which to legislate and not a particularly effective way to pursue the goal of competitiveness .
therefore , I urge the Commission to reflect on this quite seriously and not dismiss it as just an add-on to the Lisbon process but place it at the centre of its reflections and perhaps think of new institutional ways of creating an agency specialised in these matters .
Commission proposals ought perhaps to be subject to proper impact assessments and , similarly , MEP amendments , so that we actually know what we are doing when we legislate in pursuit of this overall aim of competitiveness .
Mr President , it sounds wonderful that the EU wants to create the most competitive , dynamic and knowledge-based economy .
but would it not have sounded even better if the EU had chosen to create the most environmentally friendly , sustainable , just and equal economy ?
this appears not to be the case , particularly not in the report by Mr Gasòliba i Böhm , which is an ode to deregulation , privatisation and social cutbacks , i.e. the things which create deep divisions and environmental damage .
for example , my own country Sweden has in the past been a very egalitarian country .
according to many reports since joining the EU , it is now a country where divisions , antagonism and inequality are increasing the most rapidly .
I would like to recommend all market fundamentalists to read the following in today &apos; s Guardian , &quot; California and New Zealand that were once keen privatisers are now both turning their backs on deregulation .
they are ready to renationalize .
California is turning dramatically left .
new Zealand &apos; s experiment in market fundamentalism has failed &quot; .
with this in mind , I wonder what the Swedish Presidency intends to do now .
the Swedish Presidency was in fact recently praised by The Economist for the egalitarian traditions in Sweden .
are you now going to continue down the EU &apos; s incorrect road towards deregulation fundamentalism ?
or will you instead perhaps regain some sort of tradition of solidarity and try to move the EU in a direction which takes more account of environmental friendliness , sustainability and solidarity ?
it would be interesting to receive an answer on this .
Mr President , I agree with Mr Bullmann when he emphasises a number of positive signals from the Lisbon Summit .
I am thinking particularly of the demand for full employment , but also the emphasis on dynamic growth , innovation and lifelong learning .
however , I wonder how this links up with the Maastricht model &apos; s emphasis on stability , inflation control , low wage policy and social savings .
has this belt-tightening policy been abolished on the basis of the Lisbon decisions ?
no , clearly not .
the Commission &apos; s current action against Ireland shows that the Maastricht model lives on , for in many ways , Ireland is a prime example of the growth policy which has been promoted as a result of the Lisbon European Council and which is now being punished by the EU .
my conclusion is therefore that the EU has two contradictory economic models : one which is , for the time being , political reality and another which is a matter of dreams and visions about what is to succeed it .
there is a &apos; dream of the left &apos; and a &apos; dream of the right &apos; , which both seem to be covered by the Lisbon concept .
I naturally hope that , at the Stockholm European Council , the Swedish Government will highlight and prioritise the left-wing model which stresses the importance of full employment and a socially responsible development policy and rejects the trend towards liberalisation , deregulation , flexibility , etc .
but we will have to wait and see what happens when we get to Stockholm .
Mr President , at the outset I want to take the opportunity of congratulating Mr Gasòliba i Böhm on the preparation and presentation of his report .
I wish during this debate to take the opportunity of addressing economic growth , in particular in my own country of Ireland .
let me immediately state that I support the provisions of the Treaty of Amsterdam which call for the need to coordinate broad economic policies of the various participating Member States within the single European currency .
however , any proposals which are brought forward in this regard , whether it be via the European Commission or otherwise , must be fair and they must be balanced .
Ireland has consistently supported the European Union and this has been borne out in all of the referenda in my country , where the citizens - and it does not happen in every country - have been given the right to express their views in relation to Europe .
I do not believe that the proposals which were put forward by the European Commissioner , Mr Solbes , were particularly balanced with regard to these proposed recommendations concerning the workings of the Irish economy at this time .
it is important to substantiate this and it is important to note that for a number of years the economic growth in my country has been between 10 and 12 % - in sharp contrast with the late 1980s when it was 0 % .
the provision for the current year is for a growth of around 8 % .
unemployment figures are as close as you will get to full employment in today &apos;s Union .
we are one of the few Member States making massive provisions for future pensions .
we are proud of the fact that many countries in the world are desperately trying to improve their economic situation and they are using the Irish model as a reference .
and yes , Mr President and Commissioner , our inflation is falling .
it is falling significantly - and am I wrong in stating that other Member States have higher inflation rates than ours ?
I did not hear that mentioned recently .
it seems to me that the biggest sin we have committed in our country is to reward the people with tax cuts and increases in salary .
here , the Commission conveniently forgets that before the economic boom the citizens of our country were required to make major sacrifices in order to achieve that boom .
but according to the Commission there can be no question of them reaping the benefits .
are we to be the victims of our own success ?
it is for these reasons I believe that those detractors who are voicing concerns about the operation of the Irish economy are over-reacting .
the majority of the people in my own country support our Minister for Finance and the only people who do not are those in opposition in my country and they are using the recommendation of the Commission for what they deem to be short-term political advantage .
any suggestions from any quarter that Ireland should suffer as a result of the success of the Irish economy is a very serious threat .
. ( de ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the Heads of State and Government of the European Union have set themselves the goal of turning the European Union into a truly dynamic , competitive , knowledge-based economic area over the next ten years .
we will have to make enormous efforts to achieve this and it will only be possible if we succeed in mobilising the forces which are currently slumbering in European enterprises and in European research and training establishments , in the context of an open market economy .
we are on the right path .
I found what Mr Prodi said yesterday very encouraging .
soon , the single currency will be introduced and an optimum currency area will be created through enhanced mobility within the European Union .
we are moving forwards in terms of protecting intellectual property , which is also important if we want to mobilise research .
I believe that the European patent is an important step along this road .
we also need to move more quickly in liberalising telecommunications , energy and the postal services , if we want to get closer to these goals .
we also need to create a European economic policy based on common principles and I am convinced that can only be done in terms of a social market economy .
but the question is this : who is responsible for this economic policy ?
or are the responsibilities different ?
there are areas which are clearly allocated to the European Union : the area of competition , where the European Union has the strongest powers ; the area of monetary stability , which is monitored by the European Central Bank , and the Stability and Growth Pact - these are the most important instruments .
they are the areas which fall to the European Union .
there are other areas where responsibility clearly lies with the Member States , such as taxes , social security systems and training .
here , Europe can only make a contribution through dialogue ; it is not empowered to make decisions .
as far as the collection of data is concerned , which Mr Bullmann proposed , my opinion is that , clearly , for us in the European Union , the areas where the European Union makes decisions must be given top priority .
in areas in which the European Union contributes through dialogue , the collection of data need only be accorded secondary priority .
where do I think these priorities lie ?
in which areas will we need more information before long ?
we need more up-to-date information for example on the development of GDP and its components .
we need more data on the growth of services in the European Union .
we know a great deal about production in the European Union but too little about the development of services .
at the moment , we have inadequate data on the balance of payments of Euroland , and these are fundamental principles which underpin decision making , for example when the European Central Bank takes its decisions on interest rates .
as regards other data , the essential thing is to get a dialogue going in order to come up with the principles of benchmarking .
I must make it very clear that , in the case of data collected in this area , I would regard it as disastrous if , once it is available , such data was misused for planned economic intervention in the economic affairs of the European Union , and we need to build in the relevant safeguards in advance .
this data , which I believe , in full agreement with Mr Bullmann , we need , must be used to increase competition between Member States .
by having common borders on the outside and open borders on the inside allowing the free circulation of people , goods , services and capital , we in the European Union have created competition not only between enterprises but also between Member States , which is aimed at offering the people of Europe the services they expect from the state at better prices and under better conditions .
it is my firm belief that the data mentioned in the Bullmann report should be used for this purpose .
I shall give the floor to Mr Rack for a procedural motion .
vote
Madam President , following yesterday &apos;s constructive debate , we meet today for Parliament to vote on this directive which will be a cornerstone in the establishment of a harmonised legal framework on copyright in the digital environment .
as we indicated yesterday , the Commission is in a position to accept all the compromise amendments of the rapporteur and the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market that have already been adopted in the Legal Affairs Committee , that is to say Amendments Nos 1 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 14 and 15 .
however , the Commission has concerns about some of the other amendments adopted in the Legal Affairs Committee and therefore cannot accept Amendments Nos 2 , 4 , 11 , 12 and 13 .
moreover , a series of further amendments , Amendments Nos 16 to 45 , have also been tabled for the plenary session .
all these further amendments are unacceptable to the Commission .
today &apos;s vote is of utmost importance for the future of copyright and related rights in the information society .
thank you , Commissioner Solbes , and I shall give the floor to Mr Cashman for a procedural motion .
Madam President , I would like to inform the House that , as a substantial rightholder in the audio-visual sector , I have a direct financial interest in the issue before the House and will accordingly be abstaining throughout .
thank you , Mr Cashman , for sharing this information .
. ( de ) Madam President , I would like to make a similar announcement to this House .
I think that many in this Chamber are affected , as authors .
but as far as Amendment No 33 is concerned , I am particularly biased . I will definitely not be voting on Amendment No 33 .
thank you too , Mrs Echerer , for your honesty .
Madam President , I would like to declare my economic interest and for this reason I will not be taking part in the vote .
Madam President , there will of course be many Members who will have some direct or indirect financial interest in this matter , in most cases to a rather small extent .
Parliament &apos;s Rules of Procedure however state that Members must declare their direct financial interests if they are going to speak in the debate .
I refer to Article 1 of Annex I of our Rules of Procedure .
the Rules do not require us to register such an interest before voting .
if every Member who has an interest is now going to get up and declare it before we start this vote , we will only start the vote at 1.00 p.m.
such interests are registered in the written declaration of Members &apos; interests , so they are there for the public to see ; that declaration will also soon be on the Internet following the vote in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs last week .
given that this issue is very clearly understood , I think that we can agree that all Members who are in this situation should abstain .
there is no need to declare this before the vote ; if you agree , we shall proceed in this way .
otherwise , we can continue ; I have a long list of Members who have requested the floor .
I only hope that there will be some Members left to vote .
Madam President , as I have declared it to other people already I thought it was only fair to declare it to this House that I will be abstaining because of pecuniary interests .
Madam President , the same applies to me as a major international publisher and broadcasting company .
I shall be abstaining .
Madam President , I would willingly have gone along with Mr Corbett &apos; s suggestion but , since everybody else is doing it , my financial interests are obvious .
I will be abstaining .
Madam President , I would also alert you to the fact that I have a vested interest in copyright matters in connection with Danish Radio , and I am therefore abstaining from voting .
Madam President , I am actually in the same situation .
at the same time I would be interested whether there is some borderline , and indeed to know where it runs to mark where the advantage is so clearly perceptible that one should abstain from voting on this very important matter .
now that we have started , I think that the Members who wish to declare their interest explicitly may do so , unless they choose otherwise .
Madam President , following a point of order made by Mr Corbett , entirely correctly referring to the Rules on this , I should like to draw to the attention of the House that on the previous vote of the Bowe report , if everybody in this House who had an interest in pharmaceutical companies through shareholdings had declared an interest , we probably would not have arrived at the majority required .
it is therefore important that Members do not need to abstain on the vote .
they need only to make a declaration of interest in committee or in Parliament if they speak on the matter .
otherwise we shall find we are short of majorities on a number of votes where people legitimately have interests .
Mr Blak , Mr Nogueira Román , Mr Turchi , Mr Speroni and Mr Blokland are in the same position .
we can now , therefore , proceed to the vote .
before the vote on Amendment No 11
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to table an oral amendment . I have the English text in front of me .
after the phrase , &quot; their own past archive productions produced or commissioned &quot; should be added , &quot; no later than December 1996 &quot; . then it goes on , &quot; by them under their own editorial control &quot; .
the background to this is quite simple , in December 1996 the WIPO Agreement was concluded .
we want to ensure it only covers archive productions which were produced before December 1996 .
Mr Lehne , in your speech , you made it very clear that you are proposing an oral amendment .
Madam President , on behalf of the Socialist Group , I wish to say that we are against the tabling of this oral amendment .
Madam President , it is with regard to Amendment No 32 in which the English uses the phrase &quot; may use works &quot; and the Swedish uses &quot; tillgång till &quot; &#91; literally &quot; access to &quot; &#93; .
this is not the same , so I request correction in all language versions .
ideally , this point should have been made before the vote .
I think that you are absolutely right in stating that this must be investigated properly before voting .
however , in this case , Amendment No 32 has been rejected , and that settles the issue , I believe .
before the vote on Amendment No 38
Madam President , the Dutch version of Amendment No 38 has not been correctly worded .
it should follow the English version , which reads , &quot; a natural person for his or her private use &quot; .
the words &quot; his or her &quot; are not present in the Dutch version , so this must be adapted in accordance with the English text .
indeed , Mr De Clercq , we shall do that if the amendments are adopted .
before the vote on Amendment No 35
Madam President , I would just like to say that here too the German version is incorrect .
we are sticking with the English version , in which the words &quot; his or her &quot; have been added .
( the President declared the common position approved as amended ) President .
I note , from the Members &apos; comments , that we must pay particular attention to the consistency between the various language versions .
Madam President , as my colleague , Mr Liikanen , announced in the debate that took place yesterday , the Commission can accept Amendments Nos 1 , 7 and 8 , and it can also accept in principal Amendments Nos 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 and 10 .
the amendment that the Commission cannot accept is No 9 .
Madam President , I just wanted to explain that this directive on a uniform bus for Europe was rejected by all groups at first reading .
then there were 90 pages ; today there are 150 .
that is why the European People &apos; s Party has brought in Amendment No 9 .
I support referring this draft directive back to committee because , after the standardisation of the European cucumber , we do not want the standardisation of the European bus as well .
I call on my colleagues to vote against it .
( applause from the right )
( the President declared the common position approved as amended )
report ( A5-0025 / 2001 ) by Mrs Müller , on behalf of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy , on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to food supplements &#91; COM ( 2000 ) 222 - C5 ­ 0234 / 2000 - 2000 / 0080 ( cod ) &#93;
Madam President , the reason why I have asked permission to speak is because , pursuant to Article 144 of the Rules of Procedure , the EDD Group is requesting that the matter be referred back to committee .
the background to this request is important and something of a matter of principle inasmuch as the proposal for a directive is alleged to have been issued pursuant to Article 95 and therefore to be a proposal for an internal market directive .
in fact , the directive in view is overwhelmingly concerned with health policy , which is why , legally , it pertains to another part of the Treaty , namely Article 152 .
this is an issue which is not unimportant as a matter of principle because Article 152 makes it clear that harmonisation cannot take place within the health sphere .
however , a series of other measures may be adopted .
what is worth noting and justifies the group &apos; s request for the matter to be referred back to committee is the fact that no light has been shed anywhere , either in the Commission &apos; s proposal or in Mrs Müller &apos; s report , on this crucial issue of where authority basically lies , and I would refer to a whole range of decisions from the European Court of Justice concerning this line of demarcation .
the least we must demand is that the issue be investigated , and we would therefore ask for the matter to be referred back to committee .
Mr Krarup , on behalf of his group , has just moved a request for referral back to committee .
in accordance with the Rules of Procedure , I shall put this to the House .
is there a speaker in favour of this request ?
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , during yesterday evening &apos; s sitting , Mr Krarup tried to refer the Commission proposal , the directive and the report back to committee and to block them .
I regret this very much because the Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities was not involved in the early phases of the work on the report , either in committee or through the tabling of amendments .
secondly , I would like to point out that we are not dealing with Article 152 here , on health , but with Article 153 , which concerns consumer protection .
for this reason , I ask that we vote on this report today and that we do not refer it back to committee .
Mrs Müller , the rapporteur , has spoken against the referral back to committee .
is there a speaker in favour of the request ?
Madam President , I should like to speak in favour of the proposal for I believe that , if the least suspicion can be created that we are exceeding the legal basis for our work , then we have a problem in a Parliament which takes a serious approach to its work .
I believe that , as long as this matter has not been fully investigated , it is wise not to take a final decision , and I am therefore warmly in favour of referring the matter back to committee .
Madam President , I am sorry . I did try to avoid this , but perhaps we should base our arguments on the facts and on the system of law in the European Union .
in the context of the internal market we are obliged to work at harmonising legislation in the area of consumer protection too .
that is exactly what we are doing with the present legislation , for which Mrs Müller is the rapporteur .
we are harmonising existing legislation on food supplements in the Member States and one of the reasons why we are doing this is to protect consumers .
the intention is not to overstep the competences of the European Parliament , and we are simply doing what we are doing in other areas .
the Court of Justice will agree with us at all times .
anyone who today tries to postpone it and to get it taken off the agenda is doing so using invalid arguments .
before we proceed to the vote on the motion for referral back to committee , Mr Corbett has requested the floor on a procedural motion .
Madam President , this request from the EDD Group is actually an abuse of our procedures .
if the EDD Group were really concerned with this issue , it would have tabled an amendment to the legal basis of the proposal at committee stage , or at first reading , or when it came to the committee at second reading .
to come back now and make this procedural motion in Parliament because they have failed to do their homework in committee is really abusing the Rules of Procedure .

report ( A5-0015 / 2001 ) by Mr Lange , on behalf of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy , on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive amending Directive 97 / 24 / EC on certain components and characteristics of two or three-wheel motor vehicles &#91; COM ( 2000 ) 314 - C5 ­ 0334 / 2000 - 2000 / 0136 ( cod ) &#93;

Madam President , I ask if Amendment No 3 has been checked for admissibility , as it is wholly discriminatory on grounds of religion .
I shall ask Mr Swoboda .
I believe that this amendment is admissible .
Madam President , I do not discern any discriminatory content .
it was accepted almost unanimously in committee , in the presence of Baroness Nicholson in fact .
I do not see a problem .
this is the first time that something like this has arisen .
that is what I think as well .
however , thank you , Mr Swoboda , for your comments .
Madam President , my apologies . amendment No 9 is discriminatory , in my view , on grounds of religion .
( Parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
. the European Parliament has been asked to give its assent to this agreement between the European Union and the United States of America in the field of higher education and vocational education and training .
as rapporteur for the European Parliament I gave my support to this agreement as cooperation of this kind is essential in today &apos;s global society .
I believe that there is a great deal to be gained on both sides with this agreement .
European skills in business and technology can be enhanced both by learning from American teachers and with American students .
the same model could be reversed to help improve American knowledge of language teaching methods and working in multi-cultural contexts .
this is borne out by the agreement itself , which was inspired in the United States by their observation and admiration of the ERASMUS programme .
I am sure that the European Parliament would welcome a greater involvement in the discussions for this agreement , and hope that MEPs are consulted at an earlier stage of the proceedings than for this set of negotiations .
the Committee on Culture , Youth , Education , the Media and Sport was notified of the agreement only a few weeks before the negotiations with the American authorities .
the agreement is to receive EUR 8.6 million for its five-year duration .
I would propose that research be carried out from next year into how private funding can be used to supplement this figure .
discussions with the Commission and the American authorities have shown enthusiasm for the idea , and I hope it is one that the European Parliament , European Commission and US Administration can cooperate on .
as I set out in my explanatory statement , the programme would also benefit from being given a name that would help raise its profile among students , universities and the general public .
part of the reasoning behind the programme is to serve as a symbol of cross-Atlantic cooperation , and so it needs to be as widely known as possible .
in this , too , I have received positive feedback from the other concerned parties , and I trust that it is one that can be discussed in greater length in time for the next agreement in 2005 .
I personally think we should consider the following names of statesmen associated with US-European relations : Churchill , Eisenhower or Lafayette , any of whom in my opinion would be an appropriate name for this programme .
Bowe report ( A5-0032 / 2001 )
Madam President , Bonino List Members have voted in favour of this directive on the deliberate release into the environment of genetically modified organisms .
it is certainly an important vote because this directive takes account of the precautionary principle without confusing it with prohibition , and , after three years of work , we believe we have taken an important step forwards .
however , Members will allow me to hope that Parliament is willing to grant the same openness to research into biotechnology in the medical and health field .
when people talk of bioengineering they are actually talking about a huge sector which is opening up , not only in food but also in medical research , and I hope this Parliament will want to reverse its decision to block research and therapeutic cloning .
that is what today &apos; s vote means .
I hope the vetoes and bans will be removed in this way , but , above all , I hope this openness will not just apply to agribusiness but also , and as soon as possible , to the field of medical research , and that it will not be overshadowed by clerical or religious vetoes .
Madam President , the Pensioners Party has voted in favour of opening up the production and marketing of GMOs , the subject of Mr Bowe &apos; s report . why ?
because pensioners are waiting for the wine that rejuvenates ; pensioners are waiting for the wine that does not intoxicate ; pensioners are waiting for the wine that does not damage the liver , the wine that makes men fascinating , and indeed the champagne that makes women , even mothers-in-law , utterly beautiful .
and finally , Italians are waiting for GMOs to make bistecca alla fiorentina completely harmless so they can consume that choice Italian and European delicacy without a care in the world .
. the ban will remain because new GMO approvals are not acceptable until an adequate EU biosafety framework has been completed and been implemented by all Member States .
such approvals would , in fact , contravene the precautionary principle to which the new directive makes explicit reference and they would put the environment and consumers &apos; health at risk .
the Member States should resist any attempts to lift the de facto moratorium by &apos; gentleman &apos;s agreements &apos; with biotech companies .
due to Green efforts , the new directive will also require all locations of GMO releases to be recorded in a public register .
it will also ensure new and higher safety standards for the protection of the environment and human health , it is based on a broadened risk assessment approach and introduces new concepts of traceability and monitoring which might help to identify and remedy adverse effects of GMOs at an earlier stage .
however , elements of this framework , the traceability and labelling of GMOs and their derivatives , the liability for damage caused by GMOs and the implementation of the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety have not yet been addressed through any legislation .
to vote in favour of the directive would be like buying a pig in a poke .
more than 6 000 hectares of farmland in four Member States of the European Union were sown last year with oilseed rape varieties contaminated by genetically modified plants .
under the directive Member States are required to terminate such unauthorised releases .
. there is much to be welcomed in the new directive when compared to its predecessor .
I particularly welcome the recognition of the possible wider direct and indirect effects and risks of the release of GMOs into the environment .
I am pleased that there will be a public register of the location of GMOs whether deliberately released or placed on the market .
the requirement concerning the termination of unauthorised releases also clarifies the need for a consistent response .
however , I regret the delay on the ban of antibiotic markers and the qualification attached to this ban , the streamlining and setting of shorter deadlines for the authorisation procedures and a number of other factors in this final result .
I have therefore abstained in the vote .
the whole regulatory package is not yet clear : for example in relation to liability and the export to non-GMO states .
neither am I convinced that the research capability currently exists to fully assess the factors contained in the directive .
the needs of our environment and biodiversity should be paramount in this area .
I do not believe that is the currently the position of Council .
- ( SV ) We Swedish Social Democrats are voting in favour of the proposal approved by the Conciliation Committee .
this is not a stand for or against genetically modified products , but a way of regulating our current reality .
we have a responsibility as politicians to ensure that this area is regulated .
the result of not approving the new text is that we retain the old legislation , which has not kept up with new developments in the field of gene technology .
we must trust that the Commission will present a clear proposal regarding traceability and labelling , as it has promised .
consumers must be able to choose whether or not to buy GMO products .
we believe it is important to establish clear rules in this area .
once again , I refused to approve the draft directive on the deliberate release into the environment of genetically modified organisms , as it stands following the work of the Conciliation Committee of the Council and the European Parliament . I also refused to approve it at its first two readings in the European Parliament , which were held on 11 February 1999 and 12 April 2000 .
quite apart from the strategic reason that I already explained in the course of the main debate ( we risk being duped if we accept the implementation of an authorisation procedure and then , tomorrow , the moratorium is lifted without further guarantees ) , the content of this text , in our opinion , still appears to be far from satisfactory .
admittedly , we noted that some progress has been made on the timetable for the gradual elimination of antibiotic-resistant markers in GMOs .
however , there are still some disturbing grey areas .
first of all , no progress has been made on the issue of liability or any requirement for those who release GMOs to take out insurance .
the Commission has merely made a rather vague promise to &quot; bring forward proposals &quot; , but these certainly will not be regarding the requirement for insurance , which neither the Commission nor the GMO producers want .
furthermore , authorisations for placing products onto the market are based on a ten-year period , which is far too long , and this is Parliament &apos; s fault , since it has let itself be influenced by pressure groups .
the national safeguard clause in Article 23 is too weak , as a Member State may find itself bound by an authorisation for placing products onto the market that would be valid throughout the European Community .
to sum up , of all these disheartening provisions , we support those which are concerned with keeping the public informed , i.e. notifying the relevant authorities of the locations where GMO crops are grown for commercial purposes and having these locations &quot; made known to the public in a manner deemed appropriate by the authorities &quot; .
in other words , in this matter , there will be no requirement to give honest and open information .
this policy of restricting information reminds us of the method the Commission already used at the beginning of the 1990s , when the mad cow epidemic was spreading .
there is no doubt that the European authorities are repeat offenders .
our vote against this report is not a vote against research into agriculture or against the scientists who carry out research in this area .
however , the results of this research are inevitably used by agri-foodstuffs corporations as the results strengthen their dominant role in the agriculture industry , because farmers must increasingly go through these corporations to buy seed etc .
we have absolutely no trust in the agri-foodstuffs corporations , who are motivated solely by research and optimising profits , even at the expense of consumers &apos; health and the environment .
yet , there is nothing in the proposal for a directive which convinces us that releasing GMOs and , more importantly , placing GMOs on the market , will be subject to strict monitoring , leading to an outright ban if this were shown to be in the interests of society , even if this means a clash with the interests of the agricultural food corporations .
the fact that these agricultural food corporations continued to sell bonemeal , despite having been proven to be harmful , and the lax attitude , even complicity , of Member States and European institutions towards this issue are already sending out warning signals and we will certainly pay a high price for this in the future .
we therefore voted against this report .
we shall vote against the report that Mr Bowe presented on behalf of the Conciliation Committee , since the revision of Directive 90 / 200 on deliberate release of GMOs has not met its anticipated objectives .
yet , with regard to a question that is so fundamentally important to our citizens , the European Parliament should have reached agreement on all the issues that were raised and on the simultaneous implementation of all the measures which safeguard the precautionary principle .
admittedly , some progress has been made on the previous directive ( such as exemptions for pharmaceutical products and renewal of authorisation ) . however , we would not want to accept a directive that did not ensure traceability , labelling or the responsibility of producers .
how can we contemplate releasing GMOs if manufacturers do not accept their full liability and if we do not have a directive which regulates the issue of traceability and labelling of GMOs .
the Commission has made known its intention to table draft directives - but when will these be approved ?
what provisions will they lay down ?
we cannot vote on the release of GMOs without these guarantees .
we should bear in mind the consequences of the BSE crisis , the precautionary principle , our standards regarding food safety and inevitable risks of spreading disease to other crops , in addition to the effects on human health .
at any rate , five Member States have already stated their determination to retain a strict ban on putting GMOs on the market in the future , even if the revision of the directive should be approved , and I would like to congratulate them .
this draft directive constitutes more of a threat because of what it omits rather than what it contains .
during the conciliation procedure , the European Parliament did , however , insist on clear labelling and traceability rules for GMOs , which are essential for consumers who can only take a decision about whether to buy products containing GMOs if these products are properly labelled .
this then really is a fool &apos; s bargain .
it is more important for the precautionary principle to take precedence over the commercial interests of various multinational companies and that the protection of European consumers is the only aspect that we take into account .
the compromise that the European Parliament and the Council have reached is clearly inadequate , even though the content of this proposal for a directive is an improvement on the original proposal and , above all , because it is more comprehensive than the previous directive .
we must bear in mind , however , that there is currently a moratorium on GMOs , which , it is envisaged , will end as soon as this new directive comes into force .
since the Commission has made a commitment to presenting appropriate legislative proposals on labelling and traceability in 2001 , which will complement the current labelling system in line with the White Paper on food safety , the moratorium must be maintained , at least during the process of drafting and adopting this legislation .
the new directive on deliberate release of GMOs aspired to &quot; include all direct and indirect ecological aspects &quot; .
I have to remark that the end result is still a long way from the stated objectives and that the niggling issues have been brushed aside .
therefore , the issue of environmental liability covering damage resulting from GMOs has been postponed to a later date , as has consideration of potential cumulative long-term effects associated with the interaction of various GMOs .
it is clear that we are allowing the release of GMOs in agriculture without being fully aware of the risks that we are taking and without knowing who shall be held legally responsible for the damage either .
the authors of the directive express doubts , proving once again that a moratorium must be imposed on the production of GMOs , for ecological and public health reasons .
by merely attempting a half-hearted restriction on the release of GMOs , the directive denies the need for a moratorium , and that is the main reason why I am voting against the report .
furthermore , the social and democratic implications of the spread of GMOs are clearly understood ; spreading GMOs strengthens the domination of the agro-industry over farmers and consumers .
as such , the directive gives more than a fair share to big business and that is the second reason why I am voting against the report .
. ( NL ) When it comes to genetic modification , the choice now seems to be between maintaining the old regulation , which is inadequate I know , but which does not pose a risk because it includes a moratorium , and a new regulation , which is slightly better but does not guarantee the continued existence of the moratorium .
I made the point in Tuesday &apos; s debate on this subject that the real choice is quite different .
one possibility is to permit commercial applications , accept uncontrollable changes in nature and promote the sale of new products with a still unknown risk to unwitting consumers .
the other possibility is to extend the moratorium on commercial applications , whilst scientific research alone is conducted in the meantime .
this scientific research will be necessary for a long time to come , in order to chart what the potential , long-term positive and negative effects of genetic modification will be .
I would go for the latter option , but that is not , by any stretch of the imagination , what is being put to the vote today .
as I see it , the majority of Members of the Group of the European United Left , as well as the majority of Members of the Green Group , have allowed themselves to be thrown into confusion due to this lack of choice , which will now lead to abstentions .
my party , the Socialist Party in the Netherlands , thinks that is no kind of solution .
hence I will vote against the proposal .
( El ) The final version of the new directive on genetically-modified organisms ( GMOs ) certainly has some good points , such as improved controls , public registers , the gradual elimination of antibiotic-resistant gene markers etc . nevertheless , it allows for consent to be granted for mass cultures and , in my view , does not apply the precautionary principle in full .
the debate illustrated the considerable risks from GMOs without throwing up any definitive or persuasive arguments to the contrary .
we refer to the risks to public health ( allergies , increased resistance to antibiotics , possible toxicity ) , and , in more general terms , to the ecosystems in which GMOs are released ( threat to biodiversity etc . ) .
add to this the fact that current knowledge on GMOs is still - and generally admitted to be - inadequate , in that there is no systematic or confirmed information on how the overall genetic material introduced into the gene acts and develops .
&apos; accidents &apos; or &apos; surprises &apos; have already been recorded in specific cases of this sort of genetic manipulation in the USA , Australia and elsewhere .
even the Council &apos;s common position was adopted despite the fact that Member States such as France , Italy and Denmark stated that they felt that a new five-year moratorium was needed .
all this reinforces our reservations and our belief that , quite apart from the need to strengthen controls and monitoring , the time has not yet come to legalise the deliberate release of GMOs into the environment .
furthermore , we are by no means convinced that GMOs can contribute to agricultural productivity and development ; we are barely even convinced that they can help reduce certain pesticides , as is already being stated in American studies on a large number of areas cultivated with GMOs .
clearly , one of the main reasons for insisting on the dissemination of GMOs is that it gives certain companies the opportunity to register patents and exclusive rights to varieties containing GMOs , as the Italian Minister of Agricultural Policy recently remarked in the Italian press .
it is for these reasons that we are unable to vote in favour of the common position on the new directive on GMOs .
García-Orcoyen Tormo report ( A5-0033 / 2001 )
Madam President , we approved the report as it is an important instrument for rewarding businesses which go further than other businesses .
the eco-management and audit scheme will be an incentive .
but we are disappointed that the principle of the best available technique is not incorporated into this report .
we are also very disappointed that there is no support for it in the major groups : it would have been a further incentive for businesses in fact to use the best available technique .
great success has been achieved , however , in that this will hopefully motivate businesses to take part in EMAS , since registration in EMAS is stagnant at the moment because of the competing ISO 1400 system .
this decision will hopefully help to rectify this situation since EMAS is much better than ISO .
EMAS ensures that the best are singled out , while ISO only singles out those businesses which are better than they were , even though absolutely nothing is said about what they used to be like .
that is why we voted in favour of the report .
we hope that registration in EMAS will increase , especially in Germany , where it is already very widespread .
we also hope that this will serve as an incentive to enterprises to really improve their environmental instruments and to do what is best for the environment .
Madam President , I voted against the report on the regulation allowing voluntary participation in EMAS .
I have voted against because I am opposed to the word &apos; voluntary &apos; which appears in the title .
now is the time for European environmental legislation to get really serious .
the damage caused by the heedlessness of the past and by governments &apos; lack of determination to respect the environment have brought about the terrible , dreadful situation in which we find ourselves .
I believe directives and regulations inducing respect for the environment should be compulsory and cannot be entrusted to voluntary action and the good intentions of companies to respect the rules .
who is responsible for assessing how environmentally-friendly companies are ?
the report produced by the Conciliation Committee deems the outcome of the conciliation procedure highly satisfactory .
this relates to the compromise , in which amendments were adopted and withdrawn .
one of the withdrawn amendments concerned a desire expressed by Parliament at previous readings to be able to allow independent accountants and environmental accountants , as well as large verification institutions , to participate in a Community environmental management and audit system and issue certificates .
the possibility exists in Germany , but in the Netherlands and Denmark the large institutions are trying to block it .
I would remind you of the amendment tabled by the former MEP Mrs Van Putten , of the PSE Group , which was designed to prevent individual countries from continuing to exclude independent accountants .
I note that this aspiration was not given due attention during the conciliation procedure .
this would appear to put the ball back in the court of the two Member States concerned .
however , this strategy will not succeed because the excluded group of interested parties will continue to point out that there is now a European regulation .
I expect there to be some differences of interpretation regarding this , as yet , unresolved problem , in the time to come , and will therefore ask the Commission for clarification before long .
recommendation for second reading ( A5-0043 / 2001 ) by Mr Boselli
Madam President , I voted in favour of the report on protecting copyright .
I am in favour of European regulation of this important sector , but I have to say that , after I had voted , I was assailed by a doubt which , I hope , can be resolved in the future .
before coming into the House I met a young man , Marcello , from Pescara .
he told me - you will not believe this , Madam President - that he pins up my declarations of vote on his office wall .
I am not making this up , it is true !
obviously he finds them interesting and worth exhibiting .
well , what I want to know is this : does this directive also protect Mr Fatuzzo &apos; s copyright when he presents his explanations of vote ?
I hope so .
if so , I will be even happier that I voted in favour of the motion .
Madam President , it is always a difficult task to strike a fair balance between the necessary level of copyright protection and protecting everyone &apos; s right to knowledge and learning .
my friend Mr Poos and I voted against almost all the amendments that were tabled by the parliamentary committee and by other Members , because we believed that the first common position was very fair and well balanced .
I am pleased to see , however , that , after the battle over the amendments and all the pressure from various groups , the common position has hardly been changed .
I believe that it provides Parliament and the Council with a good starting point for resolving this difficult problem .
Madam President , I also welcome today &apos;s vote on copyright and the information society .
this has been a very controversial and difficult area to legislate in but today we have achieved a victory for common sense .
we can be confident that in our vote we are providing - for example , in Amendment No 5 - protection for rightholders against potential Internet piracy and we have also knocked out some amendments tabled by the PPE-DE Group which would have been very damaging for rightholders .
at the same time we are not denying access of citizens to the brave new world of the information society and , in particular , to the more disadvantaged users and communities .
today &apos;s vote means that we can now sign up to the WIPO Treaty and we can give international copyright protection to our creative industries .
the computer games industry in my own region represents a third of the computer games world market .
we need to protect these industries which create jobs and boost our economy - not just locally , but in the European domain .
we can now look forward to future reviews of legislation and the work of the contact committee to ensure that there is no violation or abuse of copyright on the Internet or any limitation on genuine private use or fair use .
. Irish superstars Boyzone and the Corrs have asked the European Parliament to protect their music in the age of the Internet .
it is very important for Ireland &apos;s music and publishing industry that music can be accessed through the Internet legally .
it is especially important that the success of young up-and-coming musicians and performers is not jeopardised by piracy .
the music industry would crumble without proper protection from piracy on the Internet .
the rights of authors and creative people of all kinds are a priority but the directive also aims to allow libraries to continue to make copies available for private use .
however , the libraries have accepted that the rights of authors are a priority .
in the vote , we have voted in favour of amendments that will make it possible for public service stations to develop what are known as their &apos; on demand &apos; services .
we have done this because we think it important that no unnecessary obstacles should be placed in the way of public service stations continuing to be a part of the overall media picture .
we have attached crucial importance to public service stations naturally having to pay for the use of materials to which others have the rights .
in the vote , we have also attached importance to no unnecessary restrictions being placed upon education , research and library work , two of the cornerstones of a modern democracy .
. in the digital age it is important that copyright and intellectual property problems do not prevent broadcasters using their archives .
in the UK we do not have this problem , but understand it may be a difficulty elsewhere .
based on UK experience we see no reason why that need be so , which is why the British Conservatives are now voting against Amendment No 11 .
if , however , this matter cannot satisfactorily be dealt with without legislation , we believe it should be reviewed as part of the review of the directive in 18 months time .
we obviously support the right of authors , artists , composers , performers , writers and journalists , etc . , to make a reasonable living from their work .
that is why we support their calls to defend copyright .
very often , however , large record companies and publishers of books and CD-ROMs , media and Internet giants brandish copyright in order to conceal their own interests and they take their profits from authors themselves , at the expense of the consumer , who is , moreover , often put off culture by the cost of books and CDs , etc .
to these large companies , copyright simply means their own right to maximise the profits they make from authors and the general public as well as organisations such as lending libraries that attempt to make works of art available to the general public , who would otherwise never have access to such material .
the text is an attempt to reconcile the interests of the information industry capitalists with the interests of authors and the public and we abstained on several amendments , but voted in favour of the ones which do actually protect the interests of authors and the rights of the general public .
. I declare an interest in the matter of copyright .
I am advised by a legal advisor that I do however have the right to vote as an individual author .
I am not a paid lobbyist .
. like other Members who spoke at the beginning of this debate , I have abstained in the vote because I am a rightholder in the field of television documentary archive and books .
none of these interests are directly involved in any financial gain for me should the amendments be passed , and in any event - in common with the rapporteur , Mr Boselli - I am opposed to many of them .
nevertheless , it is the wisest course to abstain and to congratulate Mr Boselli on his successful negotiation of a report which comes so close to the common position and the balance which it achieved .
I would like to take the opportunity of the vote on the Boselli report to state that this report , and the ensuing debate , raise the issue of the future of European culture , one which is very closely related to the resources granted to creative artists .
the report does not fool the cultural world and creative artists and they have joined forces with great enthusiasm .
I met several of their representatives and have read their statements .
I believe , as do many Members of the House , that they are , generally , in the right .
naturally , it is in everyone &apos; s interest for works of art to be widely distributed , particularly by the new methods of communication .
it should not , however , lead to daylight robbery .
that is why it is absolutely necessary to control the process properly and , in particular , to ensure that private copying retains a status that is truly private .
despite today &apos; s vote , the battle is still far from being won .
that is another reason why citizens should continue their battle for a European Union that is not just an economic , financial , cold and heartless monster .
( PT ) The creative output of writers and artists in general cannot simply be considered to be merchandise , and we therefore have to find technical solutions that will guarantee and promote literary and artistic creation and , at the same time , ensure that the works that are produced are distributed .
these aspects must be borne in mind even when the new technologies are used .
protecting the interests of users in itself requires the existence of high-quality work , the promotion of creativity and , of course , support for the distribution of these works .
we therefore regret the fact that some of the proposals tabled by the GUE / NGL Group , of which I am a member , which were designed to improve copyright , have not been approved .
in any event , despite the limitations of this directive , we acknowledge that some positive changes have been made to the final position and we hope that the Member States will pay particular attention to this aspect of artistic and literary creation and to promoting the distribution thereof , whilst respecting copyright .
. ( NL ) I would like to congratulate the rapporteur and the Commissioner on the result they achieved with this important report , which was very nearly the focus of more lobbying than any other report has been .
why was there was so much lobbying ?
because the legislation stemming from this report will have an enormous impact on society , and the lobbyists must act as the mouthpiece of this self-same society .
ultimately , I myself am very satisfied with the result achieved , which struck a fair balance between the interests of the consumer , industry and the rightholders .
although I advised the Liberal Group to stick to the line of the common position , including the compromise amendments tabled by the rapporteur , and to reject the remaining amendments , in view of the attitudes within the group , I have taken the liberty of deviating from this line with my vote on the latter
I believe that the purpose of copyright law is to protect the rightholders , and this could be done more effectively than the strategy adopted by the report .
I have some concerns about the multiplicity of potential exemptions per Member State when it comes to copying rights , and about the possibility of being able to intervene in technical measures , because I feel this could disrupt the principles of the internal market .
reasonable recompense will always have to be paid in the case of exemptions imposed by the government , regardless as to who picks up the tab , because I think it is unjust that rightholders then have to offer their work for free .
regarding Amendment No 2 , I believe that double payment must be avoided .
the purpose of Amendment No 1 appeals to me a great deal , but the wording goes much too far for my taste in this case .
naturally it is desirable to be able to listen to , or watch , old recordings via the digital highway as well , but only with due recompense for the rightholders , and if they are demonstrably difficult to trace it is important to have a collective licence system in place which functions as a safety net .
in the matter of caching , I would have thought it more desirable for this report to tie in more closely with the e-commerce directive .
the digital techniques will ultimately start working in a self-regulatory way and I do not see that as a risk but as an opportunity for the further development of our society .
all in all , I am very satisfied with the outcome , and I feel that it will give Europe legislation that strikes a better balance than the much vaunted American legislation .
protecting copyright and related rights , which plays a part in the creative process , is in itself a problematic issue .
it becomes more critical in the new information society , as it is called - inaccurately , for that matter .
the new technologies , symbolised by the Internet , appear to grant absolute freedom , which favours the consumer but prevents creative artists and industries receiving all the due profits from works of art and reproductions .
that is why it is difficult to reconcile the divergent interests of consumers , industries and rightholders .
how can the profits of the so-called cultural industry be protected without putting an end to the freedom that allows people to collect all the works of arts they find whilst surfing the Internet ?
for an industry that is making a profit out of information technologies , as they are pompously known , the Brussels proposal for a directive on copyright is a fair compromise .
for authors and composers , this compromise weakens copyright protection .
for instance , radio broadcast archives would be excluded from protection , as would short-lived reproductions and works of art referred to in libraries or multimedia libraries .
authors are quite rightly demanding fair compensation for the losses they will incur because of the exceptions .
in the case of authors , compromise will have to be reached between the three parties by way of contracts .
exceptions to protection would , in fact , be subject to expropriations for which there should be compensation .
. ( NL ) It is not for nothing that so many different interest groups have circulated their voting recommendations on the amendments on copyright .
creative producers &apos; interests are different to those of consumers , and together their interests are different to those of dealers in music , written works and productions .
for artists , the work they produce is their income .
society exempts them from doing other types of work by paying them for their products .
if they lose this money they will have to look for alternative work .
consumers , on the other hand , would prefer to get hold of these products for free .
whilst they still accept that you have to pay for a book or a trip to the theatre , and that museums are paid for by public funds or by charging an admission fee , a great deal has changed with the spread of photocopiers , video recorders , recordable compact discs and downloading from computers .
people pay the manufacturer for these appliances of course , but they would rather not have to pay those whose work they are appropriating in the process .
there are also companies that use artistic products to make money from the distributive trade , or as a way of luring clients for other purposes .
when it comes to the vote on copyright , I shall be voting in accordance with the wishes of the trade unions and artists &apos; associations , for the sake of the producers and consumers , and not for the sake of business .
recommendation for second reading ( A5-0039 / 2001 ) by Mr Miller
Madam President , I am grateful for the opportunity to speak in the name of my group .
yesterday in the debate , constraints of time meant that none of us were able to speak , but this is a proposal which we have supported wholeheartedly in committee and which we supported wholeheartedly today .
I was particularly glad that Amendment No 9 was defeated and that we carried the directive substantially in the form in which it left the Legal Affairs Committee under the able guidance of the rapporteur , Mr Miller .
this is a long-awaited directive and it is extremely important to disabled people .
our own disability intergroup has been campaigning on it for a long time and so has the European Disability Movement . it has taken nine years to get this far .
what we are accomplishing are secure , minimum safety standards for the design of buses operating in Europe and secure basic requirements to ensure access for disabled people and others with reduced mobility , including older people - Mr Fatuzzo and others no doubt - and parents with children using urban buses .
this is really important .
my group wishes to declare its solidarity with all those who will be assisted by this .
one of the marks of enhanced civilisation in my lifetime has been the far greater attention that we pay in public places and public activities to ensuring that our fellow citizens , who have the grave misfortune to suffer from one or other kind of disability or handicap , are fully admitted to public life in our societies .
we can be proud of that and glad that this directive has been passed .
Madam President , last time this came before us , i.e. in 1998 , Parliament rejected the common position .
at that time there was widespread support in the House for the Commission being forced to take this way of reducing regulation in Europe seriously .
we in the PPE-DE Group still take this line .
I am surprised that Parliament is not now taking the same stand with regard to this very complicated , highly technical and over-detailed proposal .
I do not believe it is fair to the voters for Parliament to devote itself to adopting a position on whether the gangway slope should be 12 % or 12.5 % .
this is why I believe it was important to keep to the approach decided by Parliament in 1998 .
I am concerned that people change tack so quickly in the second reading .
this is something which I believe the Commission really must take on board so that we can achieve a better method of creating regulations in Europe .
Madam President , I voted in favour of this report with great pleasure . amongst other things , in addition to meaning that the design and other technical characteristics of buses with more than eight seats can be controlled , it ensures that elderly and disabled people can use these vehicles .
I also voted against Amendment No 9 calling for no debate on this document .
it may be true that the European Parliament sometimes overdoes the legislation on technical points , for example when we debate the curvature of bananas and cucumbers , as mentioned by President Prodi yesterday , but that is certainly not the case when we are debating whether people affected by disabilities should at last be able to travel on buses .
. ( de ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I am speaking on behalf of my group when I say that we endorse the position expressed by Mr Rübig before the vote because I would find it totally absurd were it not also somewhat amusing .
I do not think that the Members of this House can be called upon to be standardisation experts on technical issues .
this report says , for instance , that parents with children in prams are people with reduced mobility .
the question I ask myself is this : is the childminder , or the uncle or the grandfather who looks after this child for a day also a person with reduced mobility ?
joking apart , I believe that the people of Europe who are following this debate are quite right to ask whether we in this House do not have more important things to do .
we should leave things where they belong .
subsidiarity should not be just a nice word ; it should be implemented .
. this Parliament can be proud today that it has voted to enhance disability rights .
in particular , this report is a victory for disabled transport users .
it has taken nine years to get this legislation .
the new technical standards we voted for will ensure that wheelchair access is available for public transport .
it creates minimum safety standards and puts in place access requirements which will be good for elderly people with reduced mobility and parents with prams boarding urban buses .
it is regrettable that the PPE-DE tried on a technical issue to get rid of this legislation with Amendment No 9 .
the European Disability Forum and Parliament &apos;s Disability Rights Intergroup have campaigned long and hard on this issue .
it is cynical political manipulation to play games with disability rights .
with the vote on this legislation we can as Parliament say we are legislating for all citizens for equal access and equal rights .
. ( PT ) I voted in favour of the common position because it addresses many of the demands by the Disabled People &apos; s Associations .
it does away with exemptions laid down in the proposal for a directive and establishes principles that are to be complied with in order to guarantee greater accessibility for disabled people .
at this second reading , the rapporteur is insisting on extending the concept of the &apos; passenger with reduced mobility &apos; and on conditions for greater accessibility , in line with the view of associations working in this field .
this is something we welcome .
finally , I must point out that our position has been completely the opposite of the view put forward by the PPE-DE , which sought to destroy the common position that had already been reached .
this approach jeopardised the rights of the disabled .
. may I wholeheartedly congratulate my Labour colleague Mr Miller on his report improving accessibility in vehicles with more than eight seats .
I fully support measures to improve accessibility for people of reduced mobility to urban buses with the introduction of ramps or lifts and low floor buses .
this will transform the lives of older people , people with disabilities and parents with children living in towns across the North-West who will now be able to use local buses as easily as everybody else .
moreover , it is not just elderly people , people with disabilities - including blind people - and parents with children who will benefit .
we are seeking to broaden the definition of &quot; people with reduced mobility &quot; to include everyone who has difficulty when using public transport , such as those with heavy luggage , pregnant women and people with shopping trolleys and shopping bags .
we have all experienced getting on the bus laden with shopping bags from the local supermarket , and I for one certainly hope my bus ride home will be made easier and less stressful .
these are simply common-sense measures that will make life so much easier for people across Europe , particularly in Britain where buses are an essential way of getting around our towns and cities .
the bus and coach directive will secure minimum safety standards for the design of buses operating in Europe and basic requirements to ensure access for people with reduced mobility , such as the continued manufacture of existing low-floor buses and better facilities for passengers with mobility difficulties , especially wheelchair users and parents with pushchairs .
I give the green light to these measures and look forward to a more pleasant bus ride home from Bolton town centre after a Saturday afternoon &apos;s shopping spree .
- ( SV ) We believe that Parliament lacks the necessary competence to adopt a position on technical details of such a specific nature as in the case in question , although in principle we support the regulations which follow on from the proposal for a directive .
therefore , we support the amendment aimed at rejecting the common position .
Müller report ( A5-0025 / 2001 )
Madam President , I have closely followed the progress of Mrs Müller &apos; s report through from the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy .
I voted in favour of the regulation on supplements because it is right that they should be controlled .
so many women take this pseudo-medication to slim , become more beautiful , more slender , more agile , and they sometimes do not realise that a bit more weight makes them more attractive .
so I think certain substances should be controlled .
substances are added to foods to make them aphrodisiac . substances like Viagra are on sale .
the pensioners of the party I represent have no need of these food additives and supplements .
so they are calling - and rightly so - for their regulation .
- ( SV ) We have voted against the report by Mrs Müller on food supplements .
we believe the legal grounds for the decision are incorrect and that the EU lacks the competence to push through harmonising legislation in this area .
the question of food supplements is a public health issue which should wholly or in part be decided on the basis of Article 152 of the Treaty on European Union , in which harmonisation is ruled out .
. ( de ) The report on the proposal to approximate the laws of Member States relating to food supplements is one more step in the right direction of disclosing the unnatural content of foodstuffs .
but quality not quantity matters .
food supplements should be ruthlessly declared and officially monitored . they should not be added to foodstuffs until they have been reported to the competent authorities .
the annexed list has been drawn up for this purpose .
there is no reason not to introduce the duty to report in the same way in all Member States as quickly as possible .
my group has said it is in favour of implementing the White Paper on food safety in a more forward-looking way , not only to avert distorting the market , but also to implement the overall concept of the White Paper more ruthlessly .
the checks and balances within intracommunity trade , which have been created by necessary laws , are inadequately enforced by the controls which are currently in place .
that is why the measures to set up the already approved food standards agencies must be implemented .
after BSE , inter alia , the confidence of consumers must be regained through more transparency in the food production chain , safety and proper labelling .
I would like to point out that I cannot concur with the speech given by Commissioner Fischler .
European agricultural policy has been reduced to the lowest common denominator . Europe must not shirk its responsibility .
I am firmly convinced that the public debate is only just beginning .
food supplements are a sensible option which allow us to avoid possible dietary deficiencies and to stay healthy as well as prevent premature ageing .
obviously , they should not present a health risk .
furthermore , I approve the attempts to establish a European basis for food supplements , given the differences in relevant national provisions .
however , we should refrain from working towards European legislation that is too restrictive .
I have consulted specialists who confirm that taking vitamins and minerals orally presents virtually no health risk .
we must also avoid undue restrictions and administrative hassles that prevent us , in the European Union , from monitoring scientific discoveries and passing on the benefits of these to the consumer .
basically , a food supplement should be considered to be something that enhances one &apos; s diet and testing should concentrate on the quality of ingredients and manufacture , rather than on what the supplements contain .
we must also avoid drawing up a list of vitamins that is too restrictive .
why are Vitamins E and D not included when , at the moment , because of fears relating to exposure to sun light , there is a serious deficit of Vitamin D which causes a higher risk of osteoporosis ?
I am not a doctor , nor do I consider myself to be an expert in this subject , and so I have to place my trust in scientists .
I do not understand , however , how Members of the European Parliament can hope to be involved in the choices made by scientists in areas such as minimum and maximum doses or criteria of purity , as suggested in the explanatory statement .
I voted in favour of the report , but I wanted to make these comments in the hope that the Commission and the Council will understand that overzealousness and excessive restrictive regulation are out of place in this matter as they are in others .
Lange report ( A5-0015 / 2001 )
Madam President , I voted in favour of the directive which regulates the characteristics of two or three-wheel motor vehicles , and I can state that with serenity , conviction and satisfaction .
firstly , because my nostrils are still full of the dreadful smell these motorcycles discharge into the air of our beautiful cities , and secondly because I was urged to vote for this directive at Bergamo airport , before I left for Strasbourg , by a pensioner who knew we were due to vote on it .
he also stressed that there ought to be regulations on motorcycle noise .
pensioners appreciate silence , bicycles and quiet motorcycles .
I suppose that it will not hurt for us to agree with a proposal for a Commission directive , as long as it is just this once .
it is not because we are looking favourably upon the statement from the Commission - you know our views on European integration in general and on this institution in particular .
we must admit , however , that for once the Commission has made an effort in terms of prior consultation with users and manufacturers , cost-benefit studies and realistic economic and technical alternatives .
this approach is only rarely seen in cases that we deal with here .
on the other hand , we do not agree with Mr Lange , as we do not really know if he is doing this to drum up popularity or if he was hired by our competitors to discredit European manufacturers .
if he carries on in this way , he is going to be demanding that motorcyclists stop breathing so as to stop CO2 emissions .
so we say yes to cleaner motorcycles , yes to new testing procedures that are more in line with actual usage of vehicles and yes to a timetable that manufacturers deem realistic .
however , we say no to unrealistic emissions limits , no to additional provisions that are not imposed on other means of transport and , in short , we say no to Mr Lange &apos; s amendments .
Jensen report ( A5-0018 / 2001 )
Madam President , I voted against this report on Community incentive measures in the field of employment .
EUR 55 million are to be spent and not a single job created .
EUR 55 million are to be spent on publishing , printing leaflets , statistics , and talk , talk , talk about how to increase employment .
I think the European Union should move on from words to deeds .
. I fully support proposals to encourage an employment strategy across the European Union .
we can only fight the scourge of unemployment if we work together right across the 15 Member States .
jobs , jobs , jobs .
that is what it is all about .
that is what the Labour Government is campaigning for and that is what Europe is working for .
it is our top priority and we must move heaven and earth to make it happen .
the goals set at the Lisbon Summit last year were a crucial step forward in establishing the right conditions to achieve full employment , whereby the Heads of State and Government set the EU the objective of becoming the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-driven economy in the world , capable of sustainable economic growth accompanied by quantitative and qualitative improvement of employment and of greater social cohesion .
cooperation throughout the Union is essential for exchanges of information and best practices , providing comparative analysis as well as promoting innovative approaches and evaluating experiences .
in Britain , our Labour Government is leading the way towards job creation and full employment .
not only has youth unemployment been halved under Labour , but the government is now introducing vocational training for our young people to benefit from new skills in a high-tech and evolving job market .
the aim is to create a flexible , high-skilled workforce in Britain .
Madam President , I fully endorse this report which is yet another benchmark in our progress towards full employment in a dynamic knowledge-based economy .
the very title of this report arouses distrust because , generally speaking , incentives for employment are actually about granting employers aid , tax relief or tax advantages for job creation , when , in fact , they do not create any .
of course , the text is not particularly explicit in this regard , and the basic intentions are wrapped up in general considerations , some of which are pertinent , particularly on the lack of equality between men and women in employment .
the expression of good intentions does not a policy make .
even more , this may indeed conceal a policy which provides no solution to the problem of unemployment .
in order to solve this problem , binding measures should be implemented with regard to those that hold the key to the problem , i.e. the major industrial and financial groups .
but to expect this of the European institutions is to ask the impossible .
we therefore voted against this report .
the report on which we voted today deals with a Commission proposal to implement Community employment incentive measures ( EIM ) .
this proposal is intended to implement the provisions of Article 129 of the Treaty establishing the European Community ( the legal basis for necessary expenditure on employment ) and to develop the activities highlighted by the Lisbon European Council in the context of the European Employment Strategy .
the objective is to promote cooperation between Member States and support their action in the area of employment .
such measures will be funded from the Community budget to a value of EUR 55 million for the period 2001-2005 ( or EUR 10 million annually , with an initial allocation of EUR 15 million in 2001 ) .
measures focus chiefly on the development , programming , monitoring , follow-up and assessment of the European Employment Strategy , with a forward-looking emphasis .
more specifically , the following actions will be covered :
1 ) Analysis and assessment of employment trends , general policy conditions , assessment of policy options and of the impact of Community policies ;
2 ) Assessment of national action plans ;
3 ) Collation and transfer of national experience as defined in the annual employment guidelines issued to Member States ;
4 ) Technical and scientific schemes required to develop common indicators , to improve and coordinate statistics , to rate performance and exchange information according to best practices .
in addition to implementing this range of measures , it is important for the Commission to take account of the statistical information , studies and actions produced by international organisations such as the OECD or the International Labour Organisation .
I also consider it essential to encourage the widest possible distribution of the results of any projects completed .
Parliament has also recommended that the Commission take steps to ensure that all the planned activities are consistent and complementary to other Community programmes and initiatives .
the planned activities shall , moreover , be open to the participation of EEA countries and those of Central and Eastern Europe countries subject to arrangements , especially financial arrangements , to be agreed with these countries .
I would also argue in favour of our Mediterranean partners being involved .
the European Parliament awaits an interim report from the Commission on 31 December 2003 and a final report on 31 December 2006 .
while we all have in mind the preparations for the extraordinary Council meeting on employment to be held in Stockholm in March , I voted wholeheartedly in favour of these new measures to promote employment .
the proposal for a European Parliament and Council decision on Community incentive measures in the field of employment is in keeping with the rationale of the Luxembourg Compromise ( 1997 ) , which initiated a process of assessment and comparison of &apos; best practice &apos; between Member States .
however , we oppose a method which seeks to subordinate employment and social rights in general to the Broad Economic Policy Guidelines ( BEPG ) and the stability plans .
we refute the logic enshrined in the four pillars of the Luxembourg Compromise ( entering the labour market , enterprise spirit , business adjustment , equal opportunities ) which are used as the criteria for assessment between Member States and will serve to support the development of a European labour market subordinated to the liberal economy .
I therefore abstained .
it was important to emphasise the need for a European strategy that would be accessible and transparent .
this report also calls for a quantitative and qualitative evaluation of the effects of that strategy , and an analysis of needs , so as to put in place a made-to-measure plan which takes account of overall economic policy .
it therefore emphasises the possibility of using the strategy as a method to be applied to other areas and establishing an analysis of the types of factors which indicate the employment trend .
in order to consolidate the employment strategy at local and regional level , the rapporteur suggests using part of the appropriations at that level to promote cooperation , improve knowledge and the exchange of information and good practice , and evaluate the results of the application of national programmes benefiting employment at local and regional level .
the text , unanimously adopted in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs , also highlights the need to guarantee consistency and complementarity with other Community measures and initiatives .
I also support the topping-up of appropriations for the implementation of the activities , to provide an overall figure of EUR 65 million rather than the 55 set by the Commission .
it is the duty of all Members of Parliament to work to boost employment for the good of our countries and Europe as a whole , to give the rising generations fresh hope .
that is why the Union for a Europe of Nations Group has supported this report .
Swoboda Report ( A5-0024 / 2001 )
Madam President , I voted in favour of the report implementing the next step in Turkey &apos; s candidacy .
I am in favour of Turkey joining the European Union , but I ask all those concerned to add a clause to the agreement between Italy and Turkey .
I hope Turkey will be asked to commit its citizens to abandoning their dreadful custom of abducting the most beautiful Greek women , something they have been doing since the days of the Trojan War .
their entry into the European Union will then be received with greater satisfaction .
Madam President , I voted against the report , not because I have anything against the Turkish people but because I am against the institutional system , which prevents true democracy .
as long as Turkey is not a truly democratic state and does not respect minorities or prisoners , political or otherwise , I consider this accession inappropriate .
in addition , we know that Turkey is hostile towards some Member States of the Union , when all they have done is recognise the Armenian genocide , which is a historical fact .
that is why I tabled an amendment calling for an investigation of Turkish democracy , like the one carried out for Austria .
if we want people to join us , they must be genuinely democratic , and Turkey is not .
nor indeed is Italy , in certain respects , as the recent trials in Verona against my party demonstrate .
Madam President , I have voted against this proposal because of the profound contradiction that arises from the fact that this morning all the Members that have taken the floor on the proposal dealt with in Mr Swoboda &apos;s report have directly or indirectly recognised that Turkey does not meet the Copenhagen criteria .
Article 4 of this proposal includes a type of suspension clause if there is insufficient progress toward fulfilment of the Copenhagen criteria .
now this proposal has been accepted I ask for Article 4 to be implemented and for aid to Turkey to be stopped until it meets the Copenhagen criteria .
Madam President , we remain concerned about Turkey .
on top of everything that has already been said , I would like to highlight the case of Kurdistan and the continued suffering borne by the Kurdish people at a mafia level : subjected to genuine genocide and forced to emigrate to other countries , leaving their own land .
and the Turkish Government has never done anything to stop it : indeed , as far as we know , it encourages it .
so , setting aside the past , setting aside what I represent as the heir of the Repubblica Serenissima which stood against the Turks in those days , there is very great concern , and I want to ask you , Madam President , to make absolutely certain that we are not going to have a serpent in our bosom in the near future .
. while I voted in favour of the Swoboda report on financial assistance for Turkey for the pre-accession strategy , I believe that the EU should be talking more toughly to the Turkish Government about its human rights abuses especially towards the Kurds .
it should also monitor fair distribution of the money .
in view of renewed military repression in the Kurdish south-east - with the probable aim of provoking the PKK - and recent arrests and disappearances of activists in HADEP ( a legal political party ) it seems Turkey is going backwards rather than forwards in respect of the Copenhagen criteria .
I voted against the Swoboda report which requests that EU financial aid for Turkey ( almost EUR 200 million per annum ) henceforth be classed under Heading 7 of the Financial Perspective &quot; Pre-accession Aid &quot; , along with the aid allocated to the candidate countries in Central and Eastern Europe as well as , in the near future , Cyprus and Malta .
I do not think this reclassification is called for because , although the Helsinki Council of 13 December 1999 did indeed approve Turkey &apos; s candidate status ( something I would challenge , personally ) it was specified that negotiations proper would not be opened with Turkey until it had satisfied the Copenhagen criteria , particularly those relating to democracy and respect for human rights .
this is a condition with which Turkey has not adequately complied to date , as everyone in Europe acknowledges .
in such circumstances even those who are in favour of Turkey &apos; s accession are forced to accept that it is more a virtual candidate than a real and genuine candidate .
why then should we grant Turkey a financial status which is not appropriate to its real status ?
our concerns are only intensified by the provocative actions of that country , following the French National Assembly &apos; s recent acknowledgement of the Armenian genocide .
not only has Turkey failed to acknowledge its own responsibility ( even though the crime should theoretically be remote enough in the past not to implicate the current government ) but it has also denied the facts of the case and has even taken unjustifiable reprisal measures against French firms .
this type of pressure and ongoing blackmail are inadmissible behaviour from a country which seeks admission into the European club .
we do not therefore comprehend why the Swoboda report is now seeking to implement a measure which would support these misplaced positions .
we are in favour of Turkey &apos; s being granted financial instruments and financial aid in proportion to its size and to its needs on the same basis as the other candidate countries .
this particularly concerns the restructuring of agriculture , raising the profile of the rural environment and environmental protection .
any discriminatory action in this respect would penalise not the leadership of the authoritarian Turkish Government but the workers of that country .
it would do nothing to support proper conditions for the necessary fight to impose respect for basic democratic rights , quite the opposite .
the best way for the European Union to force the Turkish Government to meet its commitments , a method which is lacking in hypocrisy and which does not allow a pretext for further liberal pressure , which only in any case serve the interests of free trade in Europe , would be to support the democratic opposition .
the initiatives by militants working for human rights , trade unionists and politicians may , if they are given sufficient funding to mobilise public opinion , make it possible to put an end to a regime which murders the Kurds , causes political prisoners to &apos; disappear &apos; , restricts the movements of detainees , tortures democrats and lets Öçalan stagnate on death row .
. ( NL ) If Turkey was an EU Member State there would be a whole host of reasons for suspending its membership .
officially this country is a parliamentary democracy which outwardly resembles Member States in terms of custom and practice , but for large minority groups amongst the population , this comparison does not hold water .
sadly , the inhabitants of Turkey are not participants with equal rights yet , because they have different political beliefs or speak a different language .
the countless political prisoners , the ban on organisations , the press censorship , the army &apos; s internal war against the Kurdish-speaking population , the denial of the mass murder of the Armenians and the Turks &apos; persistent refusal to completely abolish the death penalty , show that Turkey is still a very different sort of country at present than a large majority of people in the current Member States would think desirable .
under these circumstances , there is not a single reason for tightening the bonds of friendship and allowing Turkey to qualify for contributions from pre-accession funds such as ISPA and SAPARD .
awarding Turkey this funding would only create the misunderstanding that the country is on the right path and that Turkey is going to accede to the EU just as soon as the Czech Republic , Slovenia or Malta .
it is not possible to bring about change in Turkey by giving money to the government .
it will only come through supporting the struggle of the internal opposition there and that of the exiles living in the EU Member States .

action taken on EIB annual report
the next item is the report ( A5-0023 / 2001 ) by Mr Lipietz , on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , on action taken on the EIB annual report &#91; 2000 / 2173 ( INI ) &#93; .
Mr President , the exercise I was asked to participate in has proved extraordinarily instructive and , I must say , a real pleasure .
there were three constraints I had to manage : the doubts and questions of my fellow Members in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , the criticisms expressed by civil society , particularly through the CEE Bankwatch Network and finally the answers and arguments presented in response to both these types of question or criticism by the European Investment Bank .
I would like in particular to thank my fellow Members on the Committee of Economic and Monetary Affairs for the relevance of the questions that they , in a way , entrusted to me to put on their behalf to the European Investment Bank .
I would like to thank the civil society volunteers for their competence in monitoring the activities of a bank which , in the final analysis , has an influence on 5 % of all investments within the European Union , making it the EU &apos; s largest investor .
finally , without any sycophancy whatsoever , I must thank the President of the European Investment Bank , and his colleagues , for the good will and indeed the warmth with which they undertook to discuss matters with me , to take on board and respond to criticisms , either convincing me of the legitimacy of their approach or accepting our comments and outlining with me appropriate solutions .
we have thus arrived at a report on which we are practically unanimous .
you have been able to note , indeed , that the amendments concern two mere details . I shall discuss these in the latter part of my speech .
broadly speaking , we were unanimous on the proposals for policy which are directed at least as much to the other bodies of the European Union , and even the Member States , as to the European Investment Bank .
we fully share all the priorities which the European Investment Bank set itself and indeed with the pillars forming the basis of the bank &apos; s policy , and grant it full discharge .
we must , however , stress that times are changing .
Europe is expanding eastwards .
it is taking on greater responsibilities with regards to the Balkans , which are not yet included in the accession process .
moreover , Europe has signed up to the Kyoto Agreement which requires it to reduce its production of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases by 8 % on average by the year 2010 .
in other words , this international agreement will become binding in 7 years &apos; time .
furthermore , since Lisbon , Europe has given itself the objective of becoming a world power in terms of the knowledge economy and new technologies . finally , Europe has given priority to the development of SMEs .
Europe is seeking to obtain this position of excellence not by means of a &apos; Europe incorporated &apos; with huge multinational businesses but rather by relying on SMEs .
there are three new objectives , then , in relation to the 1999 report , which we shall examine formally today .
however , in so doing , we shall of course be examining all the policy directions of the EIB : accession , Kyoto , the development of SMEs towards achieving excellence .
we wished to call upon the constituent bodies of the European Union and the EIB itself to reorient its policy in the light of these three objectives which were perhaps not as clear at the time when the EIB adopted its priorities or drew up its 1999 report .
the initial paragraphs of the report before you are absolutely unanimous and aim essentially at expanding or facilitating loans in these three areas .
to briefly mention the points on which we did not achieve unanimity , there was the official importance of the NGOs in the preparations for the EIB &apos; s decisions , the affirmation of the Kyoto objectives as a genuine leading factor and finally , the arrangements for the prudential supervision of the EIB .
these three points I refer to the decision of the House .
Mr President , first of all I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent report on the EIB 1999 annual report and my compliments to the bank of course for the report itself .
this is the first time that the European Parliament has delivered its opinion on the annual report .
naturally this opinion is of a political nature and it casts a critical eye over the institution .
thus , for example , the report examines such things as the priorities and the internal and external scrutiny of the resources employed by this bank .
the EIB is the primary banker and investor for the European institutions and that is why the report analyses what the EIB &apos; s priorities are and whether these priorities are in line with the European Union &apos; s priorities .
where significant differences were found , the rapporteur has looked at what the EIB should give greater or less priority to .
for example , the report asks the EIB to concentrate more on those investments that enable the EU to meet the Kyoto criteria .
as we see it , the fact that more priority should be given to this does not mean that matters such as the trans-European networks should be given less priority , as the rapporteur proposes in one of his amendments .
next , the report draws attention to the EIB &apos; s internal scrutiny .
the rapporteur believes that the EIB should have a better overview of the quality of the loans .
to this end , the EIB should devote more attention to evaluation of projects in the fields of regional and environmental investment , for example .
at present , there is still too little insight within the EIB into the effectiveness of the loans .
in a normal operational management process , a company keeps tabs on the returns on its investments .
the EIB should also evaluate effectiveness and the return on investments more .
a final important point is that the EIB is subject to scrutiny by the European Court of Auditors where the Community resources are concerned .
the European Court of Auditors is then required to scrutinise the resources at the disposal of the EIB as to the effectiveness and lawfulness of the investments made .
we have tabled another amendment in order to ensure that the EIB is supervised adequately and according to the same rules as any normal commercial bank regarding its banking business .
the rapporteur proposes that someone from the European Central Bank should be appointed as a member of the Audit Committee , but an audit committee has more of an accounting function than one of real banking supervision .
both functions must be fulfilled .
however , my group feels that the European Central Bank does not have the in-house capacity for banking supervision in the real sense .
this must be organised differently , for example by the Luxembourg Central Bank .
my other two amendments are adaptations designed to remove a few minor flaws from the text .
for example , we recognise the important role the EIB has in the European investment climate and we also feel that the EIB should take more account in its internal scrutiny of the effectiveness of the European funds spent on the environment .
I am sorry to say that we do not agree with the majority of the rapporteur &apos; s amendments because he is using them to emphasise a radical and one-sided position .
naturally we also appreciate the importance of the environment and of NGOs , but other priorities must also be given a crack of the whip .
the Socialist Group has also tabled two further amendments and one of these has to do with a promise made by the President of the EIB .
this promise related to recruiting more women , so that the EIB employs roughly the same number of men as women , or at least works towards that goal .
that is also one of the European Union &apos; s priorities .
we call upon the bank to make a start with this .
I hope that the EIB takes Parliament &apos; s advice to heart , particularly where the scrutiny of European funds is concerned .
that is why we support this report wholeheartedly .
Mr President , I would like to start by welcoming Mr Maystadt warmly to this almost empty hall , but I can assure him that even when we have the President of the European Central Bank visiting us , by no means all delegates attend .
so the fault does not lie with you .
first and foremost , I would like to propose that we make a tradition of this , just as we do with our debates with the European Central Bank , with Wim Duisenberg .
I think it would be a good idea to carry on the tradition of devoting attention to the European Investment Bank here in Parliament , and I hope this will then stimulate more interest than is in evidence today .
a few days ago , you held your annual press conference , and presented the results for 2000 .
what we have here is nothing new , but it is something that happened at roughly the same time .
I think we may be able to do it next year but in any case , I would like to propose that we put the annual report on 2000 on Parliament &apos; s agenda just as soon as we can , and prepare it at least as thoroughly as we have done with this annual report .
before I make a few comments as to content , I would just like to compliment the rapporteur too .
if the press report from last week is anything to go by , he has acquitted himself well .
I think the said press report also revealed that the bank has given a great deal of thought to environmental groups in its policy , and to the environment in general , and I believe its activities have contributed to this as well .
I myself have concentrated , on behalf of my group , on a number of other key points which , incidentally , largely coincide with those of the PPE-DE Group .
my first point concerns job creation , particularly in SMEs and the social sectors , whilst my second point is about transparency and supervision of the EIB &apos; s activities .
I will talk about employment first .
the employment objective , which is also one of the European Union &apos; s priority objectives - I think Lisbon confirmed this once again - is expressed too implicitly in your plans and reports to my mind , and is not sufficiently visible or verifiable .
it seems as if the reasoning prevails that economic growth will automatically create jobs and so there is no need to treat it as a separate issue , let alone consider the quality and sustainability of the jobs .
you certainly aligned yourself with the policy initiatives from the European Councils , as we can recognise the incentives created by the Luxembourg Summit and the special action programme promised in Amsterdam , in this report .
and then you rightly took up the initiatives from the Lisbon Summit held last year and in particular , launched new initiatives for the knowledge-based economy and new technologies , notably the innovation 2000 initiative .
I would now like to present you with the challenge of aligning yourself with new initiatives in the coming year , at the Stockholm Summit scheduled for next month .
there , the Swedish Presidency will pursue the line taken in Lisbon , and hopefully also succeed in making an annual tradition of these spring summits on socio-economic affairs .
the Swedes are not planning to establish a whole host of new procedures and processes on this occasion .
what they have succeeded in doing to my mind , is add a very important feature to the policy agreed in Lisbon , that of attention to the qualitative aspects of employment .
the quality of work is an extremely important consideration if people are to be able to function properly in the economy , in an economy based more on knowledge and creativity .
attention must also be given to adequate participation in the labour market .
these are very important matters that we must concern ourselves with in the months to come .
perhaps you could take up the challenge of including this investment in quality in a follow-up initiative after Stockholm .
also on the SME front , I see that in 2000 you very nearly doubled your efforts to EUR 6.2 billion .
I think that is to be welcomed , but I would also ask that special attention be given to the SMEs that have difficulty acquiring risk capital through normal channels .
these are often highly innovative businesses too and so they do not belong to the very sectors of the economy that do attract capital from the stock market and risk capital , which is precisely why I want to draw attention to those flanking businesses that can provide quality work .
that is why we ask that attention be given to the social economy and to the development of what the French so beautifully call service de proximité ( local service ) .
I have a final comment to make .
perhaps I should leave it out though because I think I can concur with what Mrs Peijs had to say on the matter , with the exception of her comments on the role of the ECB .
what our group does want to do is pursue the discussion on the potential role of the European Central Bank , also with regard to scrutiny of prudential rules and banking supervision .
Mr President , Commissioner , President of the EIB , ladies and gentlemen , first of all I should like to congratulate the rapporteur , Mr Lipietz , for his excellent report .
the European Investment Bank is a non-profit-making body because that is what the Member States &apos; governments decided , since its mission was not to obtain economic benefits but rather to contribute to the balanced development of the European Community through granting medium and long-term credits and guarantees for investment projects in the poorest regions , thus fostering economic and social cohesion .
but if we examine what the prime orientation for EIB funding is , where have the loans granted in 1999 ended up ?
we see that most have been used to cofinance investments in the four richest Member States ( Germany , France , the United Kingdom and Italy ) , which received over 60 % of the EIB resources supplementing the Community structural funds , while the so-called cohesion countries , that is , the poorest and most needy ones ( Greece , Portugal , Spain and Ireland ) got only 26 % .
even if I am told that this inequality occurs on account of the populations of these Member States , I believe we have to think about this aspect , since balanced development will not be achieved through proportionality but through solidarity .
this will become even more necessary as we proceed with enlargement to include new Member States .
do not let it be said , either , that what is happening is that the less well-off countries do not submit projects to be funded ; what is needed is a better policy of information , transparency , aid and monitoring .
to that end , it could well begin by facilitating communication with possible applicants , providing for the use of all the languages of the European Union , including regional and minority languages , so that everybody can have access to the European Investment Bank .
Mr President , Mr Lipietz has written an excellent report which highlights two of the European Investment Bank &apos; s real weaknesses .
the first is that the bank has had a terrible information policy , and there has been poor supervision of the bank &apos; s decisions and work .
the second is that the bank &apos; s environmental work has , as I see it , been extremely poor .
there are numerous examples where the bank has supported projects within the EU and in the candidate countries which have actually been indefensible from an environmental point of view .
with regard to the area of environmental impact analysis , it is clear that the World Bank , for example , is better than the European Investment Bank at making analyses public before decisions are taken .
we have at least recently encountered a new attitude from the EIB .
there has been more talk about dialogue , openness , environmental considerations and change .
we hope this will lead to real reform of the bank &apos; s work - which we would of course welcome - and to the Aarhus Convention on Access to Information , Public Participation in Decision-making and Access to Justice in Environmental Matters being implemented in full at the bank .
I would like to say that we support this excellent report and the amendments tabled by the Group of the Greens .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would firstly like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent report and the EIB for the very open dialogue we have been able to have over recent months .
today &apos; s debate shows that the work of the European Central Bank has , in the main , been assessed very positively , which , President Maystadt , I am sure you welcome .
the European Central Bank has an especially important role when it comes to improving European Community structures in less developed regions .
two thirds of its disbursements go towards this .
but I also believe trans-European networks are of major importance , especially for transport , and they need to be set up along European lines .
we see that a common European economic area is emerging . but we also see that the traffic situation is very often still following the old limitations and priorities of past centuries .
I believe that a common European market , a domestic market and an optimal currency area must incorporate a corresponding infrastructure and transport infrastructure .
all the activities of the European Central Bank in this area are of special importance .
I also believe that the work of the European Central Bank in other areas is of great importance , especially where small and medium-sized enterprises are concerned .
for SMEs , especially those which are innovative and assume risks , simply granting loans is often insufficient ; venture capital also needs to be made available .
in recent years the EIB has developed its own initiatives which , in my opinion , are especially welcome .
thank you , Mr Maystadt , for the contribution that you and your bank make .
Mr President , first of all I should like to congratulate Parliament and Mr Lipietz on the analysis he has presented on the European Investment Bank annual report .
I share the idea mentioned by the President and included in the report that the European Investment Bank is an instrument of European Union policies , but we must not forget either that the EIB has the obligation to make optimal use of the resources at its disposal .
to a great extent the Commission shares the views contained in the report , but I should like to make a few comments on two or three subjects that I think are particularly relevant to the call for the Commission and the Council swiftly to extend the mechanism for subsidising interest rates on loans given by the bank , especially external loans as well as internal ones .
this is a difficult subject that the Court of Auditors has come out strongly against , expressing clear reservations as to its effectiveness .
such efficiency could be even greater at a later stage , when said countries are members of the European Union .
the report also calls on the bank to ensure that its risk-capital activities are adequate and to make the necessary effort to attract risk capital via the stock exchange , especially in those sectors with problems .
the President of the bank has already made some reference to the efforts made .
the Commission , for its part , has supported the bank &apos; s ideas of arriving at a better distribution of functions between the former European Investment Fund and the bank .
we think the current model , in which the Fund has become the arm of the bank for carrying out these risk-capital investment projects , is a good one and the current availability of greater resources is without any doubt a clearly positive factor compared with the former situation .
allow me to comment on the greater importance to be given to small and medium-sized enterprises .
small and medium-sized enterprises are going to be able to take advantage of this possibility of access to risk-capital , but they are also going to be the great beneficiaries in the bank &apos; s Innovation 2000 Initiative , especially in its support for investment in information and the knowledge-based economy .
all this supports the Lisbon proposal , but it also supports this possible action on behalf of small and medium-sized enterprises .
a subject I think especially worth highlighting is global loans , which are also put forward in terms relevant for small and medium-sized enterprises and without any doubt will enable us to solve two problems that some of you have mentioned .
first , sharing out resources more efficiently .
we must not forget that these global loans at the moment are practically one third of the bank &apos; s new loans .
secondly , the idea of the bank &apos; s activities being more consistent with Community policies is also important .
I think all of this will end up benefiting the bank &apos; s activities and the policies defined .
one last comment : on page 18 of the report the Commission is called upon to perform a monitoring role , especially in connection with risk-capital and also the control and management of interest rates .
on this subject in particular I can tell you that my colleagues responsible for these areas , especially as regards external assistance , are analysing the topic so that in accordance with the criteria and comments that I set out earlier we can reach the best possible solution to use the bank &apos; s funds in the most efficient way .
the debate is closed .
the vote will be taken tomorrow at 12 noon .
Lisbon ( continuation )
the next item is the continuation of the joint debate on :
the report ( A5-0034 / 2001 ) by Mr Bullmann , on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , on the Spring 2001 European Council : the Lisbon process and the path to be followed &#91; 2000 / 2280 ( INI ) &#93; ,
the Commission report on progress since Lisbon and future measures , and
the report ( A5-0020 / 2001 ) by Mr Gasòliba i Böhm , on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , on the impact of liberalisation and the process of economic reform on the European Union &apos;s economic growth .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , this is a very important report for which I wholeheartedly congratulate Mr Bullmann .
I would like to make two points .
when we talk about the special things Europe is doing and why hopefully in the future we may be a model for the world , we must be able to support our facts with figures .
how do we measure this success ?
we have very traditional instruments : GDP or the unemployment rate which , according to research carried out by the Munich-based institute , the IFO , has fallen from 8.1 % to 7.6 % .
we also have the external value of the euro . but there are many other indicators we have hitherto not taken into consideration .
that is why I would particularly like to express my support for paragraphs 24 to 29 of this report , which redefine quality of life and quality of employment .
that would help our debate a great deal .
what has also been lacking hitherto is introduced by Amendments No 13 and 17 , namely the environmental aspect , which also seems to be a special concern of the Swedish Presidency .
it is an area where there is still much to be done .
to Mr Friedrich , who spoke of the danger of knowing too much , I would say that we are rather in danger of knowing too little .
this particularly concerns Parliament , which brings me to my second point : access to information in the follow-up to the post-Lisbon debate .
it is undignified for preparatory documents on Summit meetings to be slipped surreptitiously into Parliament , and often not before they have first been made available to the press .
there is nothing unifying in this ; it is simply divisive .
with the partitioning off that is being practised , especially when Parliament is involved , the Council is doing itself a disservice .
it is simply promoting the delegitimisation of holders of political office .
why are we in Parliament no longer trusted ?
let the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , or the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs , or the Committee on Industry , External Trade , Research and Energy in .
give one of the chairmen of our committees , Christa Randzio-Plath for instance , the chance , give Parliament the chance , to work with you on equal terms .
what are you afraid of ?
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the strategic goal of full employment established by the Lisbon Council has been achieved in some parts of the European Union while many others still have a long way to go .
this not only raises a problem of cohesion - since it is not just a matter of compensating the less favoured areas - but also the problem of how to manage European development in the future , so as to promote the spread of development , and hence of employment , from the most favoured to the least favoured zones .
in this regard , I call upon the Commission to combine its economic perspectives with identification of the territorial benefits to be had from the plan for European area development .
for this purpose - both to liberalise the old markets and to prevent monopoly situations being created in the new markets - information can be very important and a bold strategy , helping the citizens participate in the process , can certainly be useful here .
Mr President , one word on sustainable development and the Lisbon process .
this was already addressed by some Members of the Green Group this morning .
what should be done in the Stockholm meeting is that the governments &apos; presence there should give the Commission a mandate to take the results of the Gothenburg Summit and to prepare benchmarking and concrete targets for the 2002 spring meeting during the Spanish presidency .
only if sustainable development becomes as important in benchmarking as economic and social values can we advance .
I will take the opportunity to address the liberalisation aspect where there has not been a lot of reflection hitherto in Europe .
we need a new merger control and a new competition policy .
we have abolished monopolies , but we will have the same operators appearing as oligopolies in Europe if we are not prepared to have a different merger control and competition policy .
we need the biodiversity of a lot of small and medium-sized actors and not a monoculture of eight or ten major electricity companies which will employ blackmail on policy-makers as they did before in the monopolistic structures .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , a careful assessment of the follow-up to what has become known as the Lisbon Strategy clearly shows that that Summit , which sought to present itself as the defender of employment , was , in fact , a powerful boost to speeding up the process of liberalising fundamental sectors of the economy .
in its report , the Commission now highlights what it considers to be &apos; good results &apos; achieved with regard to the liberalisation of the telecommunications networks , the creation of a legislative framework for electronic commerce and the definition of the European Company Statute .
at the same time , the Commission regrets what it considers to be delays in the regulation of public contracts and the liberalisation of the markets in gas , electricity , transport and postal services .
in other words , the Commission is insisting on the need to move ahead even more rapidly with the total liberalisation of the most varied sectors , including public services , and on more rapid progress in the capitals market , including the regulation of financial services .
the Commission &apos; s aim is to boost pension funds and other types of funds , but this will lead to greater attacks on social security and other essential public services , specifically in the areas of health , education and communications .
meanwhile , in the social sphere , despite the statements of intent , fundamental decisions on protecting workers &apos; rights are being delayed , as happened here only yesterday when we discussed industrial restructuring .
