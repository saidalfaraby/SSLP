that directive also provides for the emergency vaccination of pigs in pig holdings and of feral pigs .
on an organisational and political basis , the eu at present deals with all the islands under the one heading , so that even very small and sparsely populated islands come into the same category as islands with many thousands of inhabitants .
there must be a regional policy .
freedom of movement
it is quite grotesque that , on the one hand , we should have a set of regulations that inflicts unnecessary expenditure upon the small islands and their lifeblood , while we , at the same time , talk about development aid for these areas .
mr president , commissioner , i wish to thank the rapporteurs for the worthwhile work they have done .
if such a situation occurs , this shall be described and transparently presented to all the users by the tsos .
free range
it is important also to be able to live in those areas that are most vulnerable when market forces promote urbanisation in europe .
european policy must , therefore , also promote cohesion .
i conclude with a stark fact : billions of euros are still in the commission &apos;s coffers , without a chance of being spent .
regions with permanent handicaps must be regarded in a new way in aid policy .

i have my doubts over just how far the uk government will push for this idea .
i have always voiced my concerns at these repeated attempts to circumvent national parliamentary scrutiny .
i voted against the mastorakis report in committee , not because it was a bad report but because there were references i felt we could not ignore .
it is becoming poorer and poorer , with regions in which the per capita income is falling .
when finland became a member of the eu , it was difficult for us to maintain important aid arrangements .
at any event , i should like to see islands and archipelagos given special treatment .
that is incredibly important for the archipelago as a part of our world heritage and as something that we are trying to administer as well as possible .
in order to enable member states to coordinate their attitudes in due and proper time , the information prescribed under articles 4 and 5 must be transmitted as soon as possible after initiation of the study either of the guarantees and the proposed credits proper , or of any other decision which , under the terms of national regulations or national administrative practices , would constitute a prerequisite for the subsequent examination of such guarantees or credits .
politicians &apos; favourite occupation has always been to dole out other people &apos;s money .
any major change such as this still unfortunately comes up against a brick wall regarding policy .

mr president , i congratulate the rapporteurs and i welcome the commission &apos;s second progress report .
the facts as finally ascertained by the commission show that for 24 of these applicants &quot; bicycle assembly operations , the value of the parts originating in the people &apos;s republic of china which were used in their assembly operations was lower than 60 % of the total value of the parts used in these assembly operations , and they , therefore , fall outside the scope of article 13 ( 2 ) of the basic regulation .
it is undeniable that there are still marked disparities in existing member states and i therefore support the proposal for transitional funding arrangements for community aid in existing objective 1 areas post-2006 .

that regulation applies to community financial contributions granted to member states in respect of eligible expenditure as defined therein for certain disease eradication measures in the situations referred to in article 3 ( 1 ) of decision 90 / 424 / eec .
obviously , you can pour however much you like into something like this , but is it wise ?
the measures necessary for the implementation of this decision should be adopted in accordance with council decision 1999 / 468 / ec of 28 june 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the commission .
first we should survey the regions &apos; needs and the most cost-effective means by which those needs may be met .
i do not believe the policy should continue along the current lines with only minor changes being made .
now is the time , however , to ask ourselves honestly whether current regional policy meets real needs .
in 2000 , eur 6.7 billion of appropriations remained unspent ; in the following year the amount was eur 8.7 billion , and in 2002 it was eur 6.2 billion .
40 % of eu trade is already by sea or inland waterway .
those of us who want to encourage the use of this more environmentally-friendly mode of transport welcome any action that encourages trade by sea .
the 2000 eea market value for all three pmma-products was ca eur 665 million for ca 255000 tons .
as soon as a member state requesting additional details has notified the recipients referred to in article 9 of failure to receive a reply by the date of expiry of the period prescribed in the second paragraph of article 11 a consultative meeting shall take place automatically and article 10 ( 3 ) shall apply .
the apparatus shall be equipped with a high-definition sydel probe 8 mm in diameter , a light-emitting infra-red diode ( honeywell ) and two light sensors ( honeywell ) .
annex , article 4 ( f )
this agreement with china also applies to vessels flying the flags of third countries but owned or operated by a shipping company of china or a member state of the eu .
the amendment does not seek , in any way , to inhibit any of the benefits for those on all sides of this agreement , but merely seeks to review this potential loophole .
it is vital that normal business be allowed to continue .
although mrs palacio is not here today , i would be grateful for a response in writing .
firstly i should like to begin by asking the commissioner for an assurance that current bilateral aviation agreements with third countries will neither be renounced nor frozen for an indefinite period while community agreements are hammered out .
in addition , lucite was granted immunity for part of the duration of its involvement in the cartel .
last year &apos;s ruling by the court of justice of the european communities was very positive news .

competition from a third country ( with indication whether or not supported ) .
the impossibility of mergers has kept our air services market fragmented , which in turn has nibbled away at our airlines &apos; competitiveness and led to high prices .
this decision concerns the procedures for consultation and information in matters of credit insurance , credit guarantees and financial credits .
ladies and gentlemen , this is the essence of our proposal , the primary concern of which is to ensure that third country crews are professionally competent .
in the case of global credit arrangements , the member state initiating consultation shall supply the following information :
more and more frequently vessels flying the flag of a member state are being manned by third country nationals .
decision 2001 / 688 / ec should therefore be replaced by two separate decisions , for soil improvers and growing media respectively .
i hope the commission will take this matter up with the utmost seriousness .
regarding amendment no 7 , we should intervene when countries do not do enough to prevent the falsification of these documents and certificates .
article 7 ( 1 ) of directive 2004 / 67 / ec has established a gas coordination group in order to facilitate the coordination of security of supply measure .

china is indeed our third largest trading partner outside europe , and its importance is growing tremendously fast , and up till now there has not been any agreement like this with china .
bulgaria shall take the necessary measures to comply with this decision and publish those measures .
it is a positive step in building ever-closer relations between europe and china , an important boost for jobs and an important boost for those of us who want to see a renaissance of europe &apos;s maritime trade .
i would also like to ask how the commissioner intends to deal with the flag of convenience issue when such incidents as that concerning the prestige or other accidents occur .
this agreement means our position and our demands will gain strength .
maritime transport needs a common system of regulation because the sector has become one of cheap labour and despicable , even criminal , activity .
obviously , this means a different sort of power altogether .
another important thing is that the agreement enables shipping companies to engage in business activity and establish their own companies , subsidiaries and representative offices. that is also an important breakthrough .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , the proposal we are debating recommends establishing a european quality system for third country seafarers with certificates of competency issued outside the community working on community ships .
by derogation from article 2 , a member state listed in column b of the annex may maintain authorisations for plant protection products containing substances listed in column a for uses listed in column c of that annex until 31 may 2010 at the latest .
this new legislative practice will improve the quality and efficiency of the system for recognising seafarers &apos; certificates under a single community system .
thirdly , the key to the proposal is the new european maritime safety agency , the expert opinions and professionalism of which will assist the commission in these vitally important duties .
whether it concerns supplier credits or financial credits ;
in order to ensure the environmental integrity of the community emissions trading scheme , directive 2003 / 87 / ec requires the member states to ensure that when hosting project activities as established under the flexible mechanisms of the kyoto protocol to the united nations framework convention on climate change ( unfccc ) , no emission reduction units ( erus ) or certified emission reductions ( cers ) are issued for reductions or limitations of greenhouse gas emissions that take place in installations that participate in the community emissions trading scheme , as this would result in a double counting of emission reductions or limitations .

the commission thinks that the new rules currently proposed strike a good balance .
mr president , i would like to add my congratulations to the rapporteur , who has worked very hard on this and produced an excellent report which has my firm support .
respect - promoting a more cohesive society .
this decision is addressed to the member states and to the parties listed in articles 1 , 2 , 3 and 4 .
contain the information referred to in annex iv ;
i would prefer it if we did not have to talk about or lament or express solidarity with the families of the people lost in these fires , nor the landscapes , homes and everything else that has disappeared , but i believe it is a miserly policy on the part of the commissioner responsible for the environment to try to reduce the only funds we have had and to say that they have been transferred to rural development when , firstly , the countries have not had any opportunity to introduce these funds into their programmes and , secondly , the funds are not even in rural development .

there was no wind , and we must therefore conclude that wind alone does not solve the problem .
what , however , there was enough of was sunshine , and we must therefore arrange for solar and photovoltaic cells to be developed so that we can really make use of the sun which sends so much energy to the earth .
i believe this is very serious , because if they are not used , next year we will once again be in the same position .
the parties listed below in table 1 below are hereby exempted from the extension to imports of certain bicycle parts from the people &apos;s republic of china pursuant to regulation ( ec ) no 71 / 97 of the definitive anti-dumping duty on bicycles originating in the people &apos;s republic of china .
prevention is precisely what we are talking about here .
because the governments have not used them ?
the procedure for awarding community funding for actions at national level is set out in part ii of the annex .
the year 2007 shall be designated as the &quot; european year of equal opportunities for all . &quot;
notwithstanding paragraph 1 , member states may request transitional periods and / or radio spectrum-sharing arrangements , pursuant to article 4 ( 5 ) of the radio spectrum decision .
if structural congestion appears , appropriate congestion management rules and arrangements defined and agreed upon in advance shall be implemented immediately by the tsos .
in order to make the problem understandable , i have confined myself to raising the basic question to which the report gives a positive answer , in other words the extent to which the community can impose an obligation on the member states to make provision for criminal sanctions for serious infringements of community law .
the list of third countries and territories from which fishery products may be imported , as referred to in article 11 ( 1 ) of regulation ( ec ) no 854 / 2004 , is established in annex ii to this decision .
planned total quantity of ghg to be reduced or limited ( in tons for 2008-2012 ) by the planned project activity
i would also remind you that the issue of criminal sanctions for serious infringements of community law was also raised in the past in connection with legislative proposals concerning environmental protection , protection of the community &apos;s financial interests , safeguarding intellectual property rights , pollution at sea and pollution offences in general .
the common objective of all of us must be the effective application of community provisions , but with solutions which will be reliable , because our main concern is to create legal certainty .

the title of the report is not accurate .
erus and cers that represent trading sector project-reductions may be issued up until 31 december 2012 , provided that each such issuance is preceded by the conversion of an equivalent amount of allowances from one of the set-asides into assigned amount units and the commission is informed thereof .
i should also like to mention mutual recognition with the us .

in accordance with the first subparagraph of article 28 ( 6 ) of directive 77 / 388 / eec , belgium is authorised to apply a reduced rate during the period 1 january 2006 to 31 december 2010 to the following two services referred to in points 1 and 2 of annex k to that directive :
reiterates the need for greater coordination between regional and cohesion policy and policies with a significant impact on the land , such as agriculture , fishing , transport , research and technology , education and training and information society policy ;
considers that special attention should be paid to the ultra-peripheral regions and sparsely populated areas and the least favoured islands ;
accepts that the threshold of 75 % of the average gdp in the member states of the european union must remain the essential criterion for eligibility for objective 1 , draws attention to the vital role played by the cohesion fund , especially for the new member states and supports the idea of a new objective 2 to foster regional competitiveness in accordance with the lisbon and göteborg guidelines ;
notwithstanding article 11 ( 1 ) of regulation ( ec ) no 854 / 2004 , paragraph 1 shall not apply to the adductor muscles of pectinidae other than aquaculture animals , completely separated from the viscera and gonads , that may be imported also from third countries not appearing on the list referred to in paragraph 1 .
calls for the european commission to pay special attention to cases where regions have naturally emerged from objective 1 status by their own efforts but which also require adequate financial support to consolidate their upward progress ;
in accordance with the principle of proportionality , as set out in that article , this decision does not go beyond what is necessary to achieve those objectives ,
notified by that authority to the owner or the keeper of the animals held in the production site concerned by means of an official document .
as mr maccormick said - and i welcome him back to strasbourg after our two meetings in edinburgh - we all agree .
i welcome mr bolkestein back from his brief sojourn in scotland , where he was very welcome .
mrs wallis raised the issue of the signing up to the european convention on human rights .
some have proposed that instead of having this charter of fundamental rights , which is now in existence and which will probably be part of the new constitution - although some disagree about that - we should merely have signed up to the european convention on human rights .
i am wary of duplicating instruments , so i wonder whether mrs wallis &apos; suggestion is a good one .

annex , chapter i , point 8
tte directive .
mr president , this initiative aims to drive the european union forward by propagating the community method to develop european policies for european regions , rather than nations , and to establish a legal basis for new structural support for enlargement countries under the proposed constitution .
in essence , this is a good idea .

the same region nevertheless holds many great opportunities .
annex , point ( 11 )
if , in the case of indirect reductions or limitations , the quantity of reductions in individual installations falling under the community emissions trading scheme cannot be identified exactly , the quantity of reductions or limitations within the total reductions or limitations of the project activity that would cause double counting should be estimated .
action for which no financial aid from the general budget of the european union is available
article 4 , except paragraph 1 ( 4 )
with regard to economic , agricultural , transport and competition policy , for example , regional considerations should be taken into account more .
debates on these areas have been held in this parliament for a great many years .
of 7 november 2006
the share of the allowances provided by each installation for the set-aside is to be indicated separately .
economic and social disparities between the member states have lessened , but inequalities within the member states have persisted and even deepened .
if an allowance was already assigned by a letter of approval to a particular project activity for future conversion , it cannot be reassigned to another project afterwards .
by letter dated 2 april 2001 the commission notified italy of its decision to initiate the procedure provided for in article 88 ( 2 ) of the ec treaty in respect of the aid in question .
the fact is that this draft contributes little that is new to the economic governance of europe .
in accordance with article 5 ( 2 ) of joint action 2005 / 557 / cfsp , an eu coordination cell in addis ababa ( acc ) under the authority of the eusr , comprised of a political advisor , a military advisor and a police advisor , manages day-to-day coordination with all relevant eu actors and with the administrative control and management centre ( acmc ) within the chain of command of the african union in addis ababa in order to ensure coherence and timely eu support to amis .
the commission is therefore in a position to state that the funding of research planned under the sicilian tristeza control programme will be implemented in line with the applicable provisions of the above-mentioned communication .
( pt ) i can only welcome the drafting of the convention on the future of europe and its work , which represents an historic milestone in the process of european integration .
fixing the date of application of article 1 ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) of regulation ( ec ) no 871 / 2004 concerning the introduction of some new functions for the schengen information system , including in the fight against terrorism
the union has acquired legal personality , and the longed-for disappearance of the pillar structure has become a reality .
in its decision to initiate the formal procedure , the commission considered that the measure met all the criteria for classification as state aid for specialised investment vehicles and for small- and mid-caps whose shares are held by such specialised vehicles within the meaning of article 87 ( 1 ) of the treaty , while it did not raise any doubts regarding the direct tax reduction granted to investors in specialised investment vehicles because it constitutes a general measure for all investors .
we believe that the next intergovernmental conferences should reject the convention &apos;s proposal and find alternative ways of giving a positive response to today &apos;s problems .
the community &apos;s financial assistance shall be at the rate of 100 % of the eligible costs to be incurred by the pirbright laboratory for the work programme and shall not exceed eur 125000 for the period from 1 july to 31 december 2006 .
by letters dated 12 may 2000 , registered as received on 18 may 2000 , 1 august 2000 , registered as received on 7 august 2000 , 15 november 2000 , registered as received on 16 november 2000 , and 24 january 2001 , registered as received on 30 january 2000 , the office of the italian permanent representative to the european union provided the commission with the additional information requested from the italian authorities by letters dated 18 april 2000 , 5 july 2000 and 21 september 2000 and at a bilateral meeting held on 13 december 2000 .
parliament &apos;s demands had to be made a central issue , for the only way of overcoming the unsatisfactory elements in the convention &apos;s text is precisely to ensure that there is a democratic method of ratification which will allow us to move forward .
as we have complained in the past , the undemocratic methods and processes by which the convention was constituted helped produce a text to which we are flatly opposed , since we disagree with the social project it advocates .
( pt ) this report contains renewed endorsements of the work and results of the convention we have rejected .
it is a threat to sovereignty , not only in legal and institutional terms , but also in concrete areas of citizens &apos; fundamental rights and freedoms .
as regards the financing of investments remaining on the ranking list from funds made available under the rdp for the region of veneto for 2000-06 ( 15 undertakings remaining on the list have submitted applications under the rdp , see point 32 ) , the competent authorities have affirmed that they will be eligible for financing provided that they meet all the requirements of that rdp , including the requirement that work for which financing is requested must not have been started .
it is , however , not acceptable for the number of meps from luxembourg to be cut by one-third .
i voted against paragraph 22 of the resolution , as i regard the allocation of members in the european parliament , as laid down in the protocol on enlargement appended to the treaty of nice , as balanced .
why , then , did i decide to vote for this resolution that i do not like ?
italy replied , for one thing , that the hull erection capacity was sufficient .
in neo-liberal europe , public utility companies in the areas of public transport , postal services , energy and telecommunications are no longer considered to be vital community tasks but are contracted out to profit-seekers .
after the opening of the formal investigation procedure , the commission registered the case number c 47 / 2004 for case si 1 / 2003 and the case number c 44 / 2004 for case n 402 / 2004 .
( de ) i find it regrettable that the majority in the european parliament has not supported the amendment by the group of the european people &apos;s party ( christian democrats ) and european democrats aimed at incorporating especial reference to our judaeo-christian roots in the draft constitution .
even in its present form , however , the constitution contains elements that are important in terms of europe &apos;s christian heritage , in that the preamble refers to europe &apos;s religious inheritance , and the christian conception of mankind becomes one of the constitution &apos;s important foundations through the incorporation of the charter of fundamental rights .
nor is the creation of two classes of commissioner - with and without voting rights - ideal .
these are all questions that remain to be resolved .
soon , there will be no more room for a militarily neutral position outside of nato , as has so far been adopted by sweden , finland , ireland , austria , cyprus and malta .

the advantage is dependent on their status as small- and mid-caps listed on a regulated european market and not on the performance ; nor it is dependent on other conditions or investments made by such companies .
it is now for the intergovernmental conference , and hence for the member states , to take on board this proposal and add it to the draft constitution .
furthermore , italy informed the commission that already in june 2001 ( less than six months after the contract for the five cruise ships was signed ) there was a production crisis at palermo , even without the extra work planned , which made it necessary to delay deliveries .

this will be the vision before us at the euro-mediterranean ministerial conference in naples , which we hope will give the barcelona process fresh impetus and enable it to play its part in stabilising and bringing peace to the middle east and to a wider middle east .
indeed , we remain convinced that the only means of achieving a fair and lasting peace based on the united nations &apos; resolutions and principles is a process based on negotiation and on implementing the process laid out in the road map in good faith .
a ceasefire needs to be called without delay so that the negotiating process can be re-relaunched .
the members of the quartet are unanimous in thinking that its role should be further reinforced .
we have also acted to ensure that the quartet will resume meeting at regular intervals at special envoy level without delay and that its ministers will meet on the occasion of the ministerial week at the united nations general assembly .
the commission has assessed the work programmes and corresponding budget estimates submitted by those community reference laboratories for the year 2006 .
we have told the two sides via various channels that they must , without fail , take concrete measures straight away to halt the violence and to avoid any action which could prevent a return to the negotiating table .
this is why we have been consistently committed , from the very beginning of our presidency , to making the role played by the quartet ( including its role on the ground ) more effective as the driving force behind negotiations between the two parties and , at the same time , to reinforcing the credibility and authority of the european union &apos;s action within the quartet .
secondly , we believe that only broad-based international action can create the conditions necessary for the road map to succeed .
however , in cases covered by article 87 ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) of the treaty , some measures may enjoy derogations and be considered compatible with the common market .
to that end , it should be the new government - regardless of the membership of the national security council that president arafat is preparing to appoint - which should have full control over the security forces .
if they take this path , abu ala and his government can count on the european union &apos;s wholehearted support .
i wish here to reiterate our conviction that there can and must be no tolerance for terrorism .
we accordingly expect them to show firm commitment , greater determination and , above all , great courage , sparing no effort in their pursuit of peace .
it is important that the power vacuum created by the resignation of prime minister mahmoud abbas should be filled without delay .
it was planned to compile ranking lists every six months until all the funding provided for in the veneto regional operational programme ( veneto rop ) had been used up .
. ( pt ) i voted in favour of this report , since i feel it is necessary to face up to climate change and the growing threats to the environment , using taxation as an additional tool to that end .
upon the entry into force of the treaty of accession of those countries the annual breakdown should be amended accordingly to include allocations for those countries ,
the eplp voted against amendments concerning taxation changes and abstained on the final vote , consistent with its attitude on taxation .
my vote , then , is a response to the legislative body of the report , for i do not entirely share the rapporteur &apos;s concerns , which are detailed in the explanatory statement .
we differ in particular on doing away with the unanimity requirement in these matters and on tightening community requirements relating to the taxation of products .
the crux of the matter , however , is creating , as quickly as possible , the right conditions for concluding a new multiannual agreement .
by letter dated 27 september 2004 , registered on 29 september 2004 , the italian permanent representation to the european union sent the commission the additional information which the italian authorities had been requested to provide in its letter dated 12 august 2004 .
my vote in favour does not , however , mean that i agree with all the rapporteur &apos;s views .
this will bring eur 25 billion to the state coffers in 2013 , whilst there will be 2 million fewer jobs for young people and the unemployed .
the european parliament is thus going in the opposite direction from the italian government , which presented a proposal which means that , from 2008 , retirement pensions will be put back five years with disincentives - and what disincentives : pensions will be completely cancelled for five years .
the fact that marghera managed in the past to deliver four ships in 15 months does not dispel the commission &apos;s doubts , since they mainly concern the two planned deliveries within two months .
mr president , the european parliament has just adopted the andersson report on adequate and sustainable pensions .
the member states must cooperate on pensions by applying the open method of coordination , so that differences of interpretation arising from bilateral agreements can be reduced .
the second category of tax reductions concerned all installations that were operating in slovenia before 1998 , had an average of at least 10t co2 emissions per year during the period 1986 to 1998 , and have asked for an emission permit from the ministry of environment before 2002 .
the measure that is subject to the commission &apos;s investigation procedure is mainly based on articles 18 , 3rd and 4th indent ; and articles 22 to 24 of the decree .
with variations from one country to another , women receive between 16 % and 45 % less in their pensions than do men .
the italian republic shall inform the commission , within two months of the date of notification of this decision , of the measures taken and planned to comply with it .
it also has to do with short-term thinking , with the encouragement of individual egocentricity and with the advent of individual pension schemes .
the difference between open-ended and closed-end funds is that , for the latter , the number of shares issued by the fund is fixed at the outset for a certain number of years , the participants do not have the right to request redemption of their shares at any time , and new issues of shares are also restricted .
the commission notes that the court of first instance interpreted a similar provision in its judgment of 16 march 2000 , in which it stated that the provision in question must be given a restrictive interpretation .
according to the commission , no appeals were lodged because , in the absence of a legal obligation on the part of the regional authorities , the applicants probably did not have any right to request payment of the aid .

mr president , i did not vote for this report , despite being in favour of the text adopted by the convention - which i took part in as an alternate - because the report has left out the reference to europe &apos;s christian roots .
the commission considers that specialised investment vehicles perform an economic activity and constitute undertakings within the meaning of article 87 ( 1 ) .
by what date will the recovery be completed ?
taxation of revenue accruing to investment vehicles subject to italian substitute tax and acting as participants in other investment vehicles
in this way , no further tax is paid by the investors upon distribution of income deriving from such investments .
the ships were ordered by various subsidiaries of carnival corporation ( &quot; carnival &quot; ) , a us cruise operator. italy promised , on this basis , contract-related operating aid for the building of the ships .
if the bureau is not willing to concern itself with this and inform meps as soon as possible , you will have to reckon with me constantly raising this issue in the plenary .
( notified under document number c ( 2006 ) 4024 )

i am delighted by the large number of roll-call votes today , which means that i am not going to be suspected of speaking in the interests of my own wallet .
on 2 october 2003 decree law no 269 of 30 september 2003 providing for urgent measures to promote development and to correct the trend of public finances ( &quot; decree-law no 269 / 2003 &quot; ) , as subsequently converted into law no 326 of 24 november 2003 , published in the official gazette of the italian republic no 274 of 25 november 2003 , entered into force on its publication in the official gazette of the italian republic no 229 of 2 october 2003 .
the regional measure is an extraordinary measure and is of limited duration. it concerns initiatives that , at the time they were approved by means of their inclusion in the published ranking list , complied with the sectoral limits and the requirements laid down in the veneto rop , approved by the commission , with commission decision 94 / 173 / ec on the selection criteria to be adopted for investments for improving the processing and marketing conditions for agricultural and forestry products and repealing decision 90 / 342 / eec and with regulation ( ec ) no 951 / 97 , on the basis of which the regional authorities approved applications for financing .
unfortunately , the european parliament is thus behind even the european commission on top institutional issues , such as , for example , the number or the role of the commissioners or the presidency of the council .
we support the solidarity clause in the draft constitution and are , in general , well disposed towards the draft constitution &apos;s wordings on the foreign , security and defence policy .
- ( sv ) the draft european convention and parliament &apos;s opinion are generally sound .
nera : &quot; the &quot; times-interest-earned ratio &quot; or &quot; interest cover &quot; measures the extent to which interest is covered by earnings before interest and taxes ( ebit ) plus depreciation .
the draft constitution &apos;s arrangements for the commission are unsound .
since the condition laid down by article 12 ( 3 ) ( b ) of the sixth directive is thus fulfilled , lithuania should be able to apply the measure concerned as soon as this decision is notified ,
our position relates to the report and not to the outcome of the convention in its entirety .
in accordance with article 104 ( 12 ) of the treaty , a council decision on the existence of an excessive deficit is to be abrogated when the excessive deficit in the member state concerned has , in the view of the council , been corrected .
having regard to council decision 2005 / 211 / jha of 24 february 2005 concerning the introduction of some new functions for the schengen information system , including in the fight against terrorism &#91; 1 &#93; , and in particular article 2 ( 4 ) thereof ,
from the belgian border following the tractaatweg ( n253 ) in a northerly direction , change in guido gezellestraat following a westerly direction , change in willem de zwijgerlaan following in a northerly direction until the water .
the commission called on interested parties to submit their comments on the aid concerned .
the council invited the cypriot authorities to ensure that budgetary consolidation towards the medium-term objective ( mto ) be sustained after the excessive deficit has been corrected .
it is necessary to underline the undemocratic procedure that led to adoption by the convention of the draft constitution .
consensus means a universal agreement , but the text adopted did not enjoy such approval .
hence abbas &apos; lament : &apos; a palestinian minister does not even have anywhere near as much power as a deputy secretary elsewhere . &apos;
after all , ignoring this courageous , honest palestinian self-criticism renders the roadmap to peace in the middle east politically implausible - certainly when a new palestinian prime minister has to operate from the same position of relative weakness as mahmud abbas .
in particular , the ranking list contained 134 projects considered to be eligible rather than 150 ; the italian authorities said that financing was still to be provided for 36 of those projects ;
identity of the subject
that is one issue that we can all agree on .
specifically , it was recommended that the measures envisaged in the may 2004 convergence programme be implemented with vigour ; in particular , that effective action be taken by 5 november 2004 in order to bring the deficit below 3 % of gdp in 2005 in a credible and sustainable manner .
having called on interested parties to submit their comments pursuant to those provisions ,
in order for the derogation to be applicable , the measure in question ( funding research in full ) must comply with the four conditions laid down in the 1998 rules .
the commission takes the view that the tax advantage conferred does not offset any substantial disparity in tax treatment between collective investments in listed small- and mid-caps , on the one hand , and collective investments in other companies and individual investments in non-listed companies , on the other .
this decision has been widely criticised , and rightly so .
in annex i to decision 2005 / 393 / ec , the list of restricted zones in zone f ( serotype 8 ) which relates to france is replaced by the following :
neither side has met its commitment under the roadmap for peace .
i concur with what mr wurtz has said , but i should like to add something in relation to our own mandate .
in the description of the scheme submitted before the procedure was initiated , the italian authorities stated that once they had been placed on the single ranking list of undertakings eligible for aid for the agrifood sector , undertakings remained on that list until financing from the region was available .
i have read it and do not want to read it again .
consequently , the slovene authorities decided to modify their tax scheme , and notified the new - at that time draft - legislation to the commission .
the commission also notes that fincantieri builds ships of this type and that it is consequently an undertaking covered by the regulation .
at the same time , by letter dated 5 april 2005 , it sent a new request for further information on the remainder of part b of the file , in other words the funding of the tristeza control measures provided for in the programmes for campania , basilicata and sicily .
otherwise , every time we come here , we shall list our complaints , some of us from a position of security , others in line with their sympathies , but without any final result .
mr president , i get the impression that too many speakers in this chamber are referring to the road map without having read it , and that , because of their unfamiliarity with the actual document , they are interpreting it in an ambiguous way .
in this sense , we must only speak about what needs to be done politically .
we here are a political body. we are not judging intentions .
i believe that what mr burg is telling us calls us back to something present at the birth of israel and of what could have become palestine , and that is the decision of the united nations .
revenue deriving from investment vehicles is included in the net operating result of a pension fund participating in such investment vehicles. it is subject to a substitute tax of 11 % .
let me add another observation on terrorism , this one from avi shlaim , writing in today &apos;s herald tribune : &apos; the real obstacle to peace is sharon , not arafat . &apos;
mr president , there is no doubt that we are facing a catastrophic situation in the middle east , and one of course wonders who is to be blamed for it .
a little boy died when an olive stone went down his throat the wrong way .
there was a curfew , so no doctor went out to him , and he therefore died .
remember what happened the day after he had got the palestinian leaders to enter into a unilateral ceasefire .
under these rules , research in the agricultural sector may be funded in full only if the four conditions laid down in the 1998 commission communication amending the community framework for state aid for research and development ( &quot; 1998 rules &quot; ) are met .
nor , of course , is an occupying power entitled to kill in the street those who are engaged in resistance .
from ring rotterdam ( a15 ) , follow in an easterly direction until the a16 / e19 .
the first doubt raised by the commission was the ability of the ancona shipyard to build , in combination with the atsm shipyard in trieste , one of the five cruise ships ( 6077 ) covered by the notification .
with this roadmap , have we not been led to believe in an all too optimistic scenario , the premises of which have not been accepted by the actual state of israel itself ?
has israel really abandoned the idea that the occupied territories should be governed by israelis ?
she should ask herself whether an intifada has to be armed to qualify as a genuine intifada .
the obligation to recover the aid does not , however , rule out the possibility that all or part of the aid granted to individual beneficiaries may be compatible under article 2 of commission regulation ( ec ) no 69 / 2001 on the application of articles 87 and 88 of the ec treaty to de minimis aid .
there is nothing else in sight .
it can work , if it gets time .
to economically viable holdings ;
but this is a sterile debate and i do not propose to get into it .
italy shall inform the commission , within two months of notification of this decision , of the measures taken to comply with it .
the deadly cycle of attack and reprisal has to be broken .
the last year of tax reduction is 2009 : no reduction applies as of 2010 .
on what list are we going to put that ?
mahmud abbas has been replaced by ahmed kurei after only four months in power .
i do not know whether his election meets all the democratic criteria , but he is elected .
the commission registered the new scheme in june 2004 , under the number n 402 / 2004 .
prime minister sharon is democratically elected ; so is president arafat .
on 9 september 2004 the commission decision to initiate the formal investigation procedure was published in the official journal of the european union , inviting interested parties to submit their comments .
in our group , we are perfectly clear in our own minds that we can in no way justify the suicide attacks , which hold human life in contempt .
a policy of &apos; an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth &apos; will bring no resolution .
costs arising from the application of this article would be borne entirely by the region and combination with other existing aid instruments or schemes is prohibited .
let me quote this from the 8 september issue of the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung : &apos; the symbolic removal of a few containers in illegal settlements west of the jordan was too little for it to have been capable of becoming an encouraging experience of success for the palestinians . &apos;
the commission concludes that the tax reliefs granted under this measure constitute a scheme of operating aid not covered by any of the derogations from the general prohibition of such aid and that the measure is therefore incompatible with the common market .
hochtaunuskreis
we also urged israel to work harder to ease the conditions of the palestinian people in the territories .
department of ardennes
ladies and gentlemen , the european union has an important part to play in the quartet to reinvigorate the negotiating process in the direction i have described .
history , especially the history of the middle east crisis , teaches us that it is precisely when the negotiating process is yielding its first fruits that the forces of radical extremism , which are opposed to any form of peace , unleash greater violence .
the european union will ensure that the region and the parties involved feel the weight of its efforts to bring about a negotiated peace .
in der stadt pirmasens die stadtteile windsberg , hengsberg , fehrbach
the european union must step up its support for financial reform of the authority to help it distance itself from terrorism .
by the same letter , it reminded italy of its obligation to notify to the commission before they are implemented any measures constituting aid pursuant to article 88 ( 3 ) of the treaty .
however , we can have no truck with terrorism .
the surest way to ensure that outcome would be for israel to make a martyr out of him .
both sides have to realise that there can be no military solution to this conflict .
based on the estimated outturn for 2005 and taking account of the balance of risks to the budgetary targets , the budgetary stance in the programme seems sufficient to ensure that the programme &apos;s mto is almost reached by 2009 , as envisaged in the programme .
those amounts should be added to the annual breakdown by member state for the purpose of rural development programming , according to the methodology established in article 10 ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) of regulation ( ec ) no 1782 / 2003 .
the doubts were raised by the fact that the aid could be granted to undertakings that had already made the investments planned under a project for which they had submitted applications for financing for the 1994-99 programming period , i.e. under a part-financed aid scheme .
italy had the opportunity to comment on the conclusions set out in the reports by both experts .
on the basis of the conclusion set out in paragraph 70 , an extension of the delivery limit is not defensible , and for this reason the commission cannot authorise an extension of the delivery limit for hull 6079 ,
a number of participants , from both sides , expressed the belief that theirs was , in effect , a &apos; twenty-second century conflict &apos; : a war that would last a hundred years , blighting the lives of their grandchildren &apos;s children .
a conflict that has the capacity to exhaust the optimism of the best of us once again demands deeper reserves of patience and commitment .
taxation of operating income accrued or distributed to other participants in investment vehicles not subject to the substitute tax
this debate is already taking place in palestinian society , and is legitimate and healthy .
this argument is however not relevant , since the commission did not question the ability to construct the hulls .
it is depriving palestinian farmers of crucial irrigated land to the north of the west bank .
this is a scandal of such proportions that even president bush has taken umbrage at the action of his protégé .
it cuts through the very heart of bethlehem .
in this respect , the italian authorities stressed that the scheme is effectively open to all undertakings that create separate funds aimed at investing predominantly in small- and mid-caps listed on regulated european markets and would therefore constitute a general measure .
mr president , mr president-in-office of the council , commissioner , thank you , europe , for the unanimous stance it adopted at the un general assembly .
italy claims that it would have been possible to build one of the five ships at ancona and atsm even though the dry dock at ancona is shorter than the ship in question , thanks to a special procedure used once before for a cruise ship , i.e. combining two ship sections ( jumboisation ) .
and yet , four months after launching this initiative , what remains of it ?
for brucellosis , the community grants financial assistance to france for the functions and duties referred in article 32 ( 2 ) of regulation ( ec ) no 882 / 2004 , to be carried out by the afssa - laboratoire d &quot; études et de recherches en pathologie animale et zoonoses , maisons-alfort .
at this crucial time , the european union is unavailable to its subscribers .
hence , the slovene tax system concerns a community tax , in the meaning of article 51.1 ( b ) 1st indent .
the scheme is based on the &quot; regulation on tax for air pollution with co2 emissions &quot; of 17 october 2002 , and entered into force in slovenia in october 2002 ( the &quot; regulation &quot; ) .
according to the production plan dated december 2000 and exhibit 5 in the letter dated 25 may 2005 , the outfitting was to take place at ancona , but the letter from fincantieri dated 3 march 2005 states that the outfitting was to take place at atsm to overcome any production difficulties encountered at the ancona shipyard .
the cease-fire announced by islamic jihad and hamas has been called off and their leaderships have called for attacks on israel .
such beneficiary undertakings qualify for a 15 % tax credit which offsets in full the double taxation of the capital revenue received .
mr president , there is great concern , and justifiably so , surrounding the extremely grave situation in the middle east .
the united states is asking for support for iraq .
this is the express request of my group , but this is above all the dearest wish of supporters of peace on the ground who would like to be able to say as soon as possible , full of hope &apos; europe is back &apos; .
lastly , mr president , i am thinking of yasser arafat himself , who has just reiterated his determination to work on achieving a ceasefire and not just a truce , if his efforts and those of the prime minister , abu mazen , are not blown out of the water by targeted assassinations and house demolitions .
based on its assessment of all the available facts the commission comes to the conclusion that the original production plan , with delivery of all five notified cruise ships before the end of 2003 , was unrealistic .
who can help this friend at this stage ?
as the work of human hands , however , it is not perfect or polished .
transmission of gas ;
in the current markets , the refinancing of our debt is simply out of question . &quot;
i am not very confident about all this .
i congratulate mr gil-robles and mr tsatsos on having formulated this in such exact terms in the historic period in which we find ourselves !
&quot; the adoption by the commission of the legal consultant &apos;s arguments would have discriminatory effects which would run counter to the principle of legal certainty .
few are saying this - although mr voggenhuber has done so in very clear language - but the thought is in the minds of many that the issue of whether the intergovernmental conference should alter what came out of the convention , is also a power issue between the governments and parliaments of the european union .
mr president , under the constitution the present european union will be abolished and in its place a new one will be established , which , according to the constitution , reflects the will of the people and states .
it is expected that this hybrid model will disappear after july 2007 .
the senator is most welcome to the house .
governments , the commission , the national parliaments and we , in the european parliament , must send a positive message to the citizens so that they support this constitution and , if possible , do so by means of a referendum .
net income / loss from integrated companies
we are all aware and appreciative of the high quality and lofty ambitions of those responses .
the detailed rules for the effective implementation of the auction and the gas supply contracts will be elaborated by the parties under the scrutiny of the hungarian energy office , and submitted to the commission for its approval .
the member states lose their right to a permanent commissioner with voting rights , and in future will not be able to choose their own commissioner .
the commission considers that this commitment is sufficient to grant an effective and non-discriminatory access to the storage capacities for the relevant gas quantities and will enable traders and customers to structure the acquired gas according to their own or their customers &quot; needs .
we are the majority shareholder , with 55 % of the capital , there is clearly no question of our &quot; renationalising &quot; the company , as i have sometimes heard it said .
so far few customers have been able to obtain better offers on the open segment of the market from traders such as emfesz because regulated prices have remained quite low .
transmission of electricity ;
all our efforts were and still are rewarded by the reunification of europe in peace and freedom .
mr president , i will make two remarks on the report by mr gil-robles gil delgado and mr tsatsos , which reflects the hopes but also the fears of this house .
during the first half of 2002 , france télécom saw its credit rating downgraded following publication of its 2001 annual accounts .
there are many ways in which this can be rectified and i personally feel the convention could and should have gone further in this area .
the market investigation has shown that it is currently difficult for new entrants to get access to russian gas in parallel to mol wmt &apos;s existing contracts .
poor &apos; s ratings direct , ( july 12 , 2002 ) .
the convention was rightly described as &apos; constitutional &apos; , for its work shows the way ahead , over and above economic cooperation .
as far as the date of the commitment is concerned , the commission would point out that the case law does not rule out the possibility that a firm commitment may exist prior to all the precise implementing arrangements being known .
that is what the igc must ensure ; it should not do much more than that .
in the interests of all europeans , we will need , in the future too , a representative and fully-fledged commission with one commissioner from each country , one that will carry political weight and really give every one of the eu &apos;s citizens the feeling of being equally represented in all the european institutions .
p &apos;s and moody &apos;s would automatically increase its annual interest expense by approximately € 75 million . &quot;
however , the result still deserves our support .
e.on , through its rdcs , has a market share of around &#91; 15-25 % &#93; on the market for gas supply to small industrial and commercial customers .
moreover : &quot; f .
it might well survive as a perhaps more efficient body , albeit one consisting exclusively of technocrats .
the report is thus manifestly short on objectivity , adopting highly contestable legal analyses ( for example regarding the characterisation of letters of intent and the scope of a unilateral commitment in civil and commercial law ) and making an unjustified application to the facts at issue of certain irrelevant legal precepts ( this is the case , for example , with the application of the theory of business management or of the rules of public international law in relations between a company and its majority shareholder . &quot;
unfortunately , the dutch government appears very divided about the referendum and lacks a clear european profile .
i should like to thank both rapporteurs .
article 80 of law no 2002-1576 of 30 december 2002 rectifying the 2002 finance act .
basic values , social fundamental rights and more democracy must be defended and not weakened by alleged national interests , which would send us back to this cursed backroom in nice , where the government produced something of little consequence .
taken as a whole , these factors may be deemed to actually endanger state resources ( either by incurring the state &apos;s responsibility vis-à-vis investors , or by increasing the cost of the state &apos;s future transactions ) .
this could take the form of banks or the government providing the necessary loans at market prices &quot; ( p . 21 ) .
on 31 december 2001 , according to this definition , the registered capital came to eur 28,8 billion ( corresponding to eur 4,6 billion of share capital plus eur 24,2 billion of additional paid-in capital ) .
secondly , we indicated in the resolution that all member states should hold referendums on the constitution , where possible , according to the constitution , on the day of the european elections .
eur 442,2 million .
the commission would observe that france télécom was a firm in difficulty within the meaning of the guidelines , as can be seen from table 10 .
table 9 gives a breakdown , by major category , of the various components of the debt .
however , this is done to show that we too have compromised to achieve this result .
turning now to those who are forming ranks to oppose this choice , i would also like to recall the words of chancellor schroeder , who stated in the bundestag that he was not against inserting the reference to judaeo-christian roots into the constitutional treaty .
information which was considered partial by the above-mentioned commission of enquiry .
why should we accept a retrograde move to allow one or more governments to preserve what is , frankly , an unfair system ?
there are people in our union who are not religious .
see france télécom &apos;s comments contained in mr ehlermann &apos;s report of 21.1.2004 : ... &quot; during the first half of 2002 , the market gradually lost confidence in france télécom &apos;s capacity to cope with its debt and in the management team &apos;s ability to solve the problem ( point 7 ) ... once the first half &apos;s figures were known and in view of the management team &apos;s inability to reassure the markets , the french state intervened in september 2002 ( point 8 ) . &quot;
the weakest link in the proposed new treaty is the proposals concerning the council .
the commission believes that as a result of the merger , the new entity will have the ability and incentive to reinforce its gas input foreclosure strategy by adopting discriminatory behaviour in granting access to storage , even in a scenario of fully regulated prices for storage services ( as required under the resolution of the hungarian energy office approving the transaction ) .
it should , first and foremost , enshrine the value of the protection and development of our cultural identities to preserve an ethno-cultural , historical and linguistically unique heritage in the world .
if the declarations made by the state between july and october 2002 had really been legally equivalent to , or even simply perceived by the market and the rating agencies as being , a promise to provide france télécom with an &quot; unlimited guarantee , &quot; then there would not have been any downgrading of france télécom &apos;s rating in july and the company &apos;s spreads and rating during that period would have reflected the state risk ( aaa rating and very low spread ) .
over the coming months we must approach these negotiations with firm determination so that an agreement can be secured on a text for the final treaty , which hopefully would govern the operation of the union for the next 50 years .
let us be clear : we believe in a more influential europe which is independent from the united states but , at the same time , a friend and ally of a country and a people that have also made a decisive contribution to ensuring freedom and democracy in our continent .
the french authorities strongly contest that it is possible to propose interpretations as unfounded as these in order to draw legal conclusions and in particular to assert that there exists any guarantee granted by the state to france télécom . &quot;
sixty years on from the declaration of chivasso , the historic document marking the birth of federalism drawn up 19 december 1943 - particularly difficult times for europe and for our country - by representatives from the valle d &apos;aosta , the waldensians and the people of provençe to protect the regional cultures against centralism from rome , we cannot endorse a constitution that ignores the rights of peoples and regions if we want to respect the ideals of these fathers .
it is appropriate here to recall the words of many laymen - i am thinking here of the philosopher , norberto bobbio , the philosopher , benedetto croce - who insisted on the role and the importance of religions in the history and growth of europe .
it would be very costly if its word could not be believed in these matters . &quot;
retail supply of electricity to medium and large commercial and industrial customers ;
those who wish to force this constitution upon the peoples of europe should pause for thought .
if national governments attempt to pass this without consulting the people , it will be a constitutional abomination .
the state shareholder thus intends to act like a prudent investor .
free and fair referendums must be held in every member state or you will unleash the very nationalism that the eu was supposed to stop .
afterwards , the question no longer arises ... as it has already been answered.mr xavier de roux : you considered , therefore , that the continuation of the business went without saying.mr edouard salustro : no !
to work on a constitution for twenty-five , and soon perhaps thirty , european member states , is to work on an important part of our common history .
does this now mean that the work that has been done is complete ?
e.on &apos;s strategy would lead to a slower and less competitive development of new generation capacity in hungary starting immediately after the transaction ( compared to a situation where new power plants would be built by distinct market players ) and ultimately to higher electricity wholesale prices .
we now know that a convention achieves a great deal more than the normal igc .
board meeting presentation , france télécom stock-taking exercise , december 2002 , p . 36 .
mrs maij-weggen , you started your speech by thanking everyone for their contributions to the convention .
the state &apos;s direct approaching of the rating agencies shows clearly that the declarations were the expression of a clearly defined , well thought-out will .
mr president , the draft constitution is good for the whole of the union and for each of its member states , because it benefits the citizens by making the union more effective in terms of resolving its people &apos;s aspirations and by doing so in a more democratic way , thereby increasing its legitimacy .
ldcom refers to the judgment of the international court of justice , icj reports ( 1974 ) 267 .
the presidencies must be for two and a half years , and the member states must be treated impartially when assigning them .
it goes against every political development of europe in every direction .
decisions that are fundamental to public groups are being taken at the level of subsidiaries , something which , owing to their strong identity ( orange or equant in the case of france télécom ) and the specific details of their governance ( the number of &quot; direct &quot; representatives of the state on their boards is small or non-existent , notwithstanding the state &apos; s controlling majority ) , reduces still further the time available for and the quality of the information transmitted to the public shareholder . &quot;
( moody &apos; s , 9.12.2002 )
&quot; furthermore , the consultant &apos;s deductions are contradicted by simple , unavoidable tests such as the observation that , over the relevant period , france télécom &apos;s shares and bonds moved in quite a similar way to the securities of its closest comparable competitor , deutsche telekom . &quot;
the fact that these private investors were then willing to contribute at the same time is no longer relevant . &quot;
or even of anti-clericalism , which inspired the enlightenment , which inspired revolutions and intellectuals and policies in europe .
although this is a highly complex area in technical terms , we are sensitive to the economic and political consequences of the proposal , which will hit small- and medium-sized software companies hardest .
france télécom has , moreover , indicated that the phrase &quot; appropriate steps &quot; does not mean a priori that the state has committed itself to adopting financial measures .
in order to remove the competition concerns identified during the procedure , e.on submitted on 20 october 2005 a package of commitments .
mention may also be made of the recent judgment of the court of justice in case c-1 / 00 commission v france &#91; 2001 &#93; ecr i-9989 , in which the court punished an infringement ( consisting in failing to comply with a decision ) evidenced by a refusal mentioned in a press release .
... &quot; ( 205 ) the interview has never been disowned by the french authorities .
it remains to be seen in the analysis of the votes whether this objective has been achieved .
as rapporteur , i supported the thrust of amendments tabled with a view to getting a clearer definition of what is patentable and limits to ensure that pure software is not patentable .
as to the compatibility of the aid in question , the commission would point out first of all that its analysis as set out in paragraphs 122 and 123 of the opening decision is still applicable in the present case .
the stable outlook shows that the rating has bottomed out , added deslondes . &quot;
the european parliament has thus done innovation and technological development a disservice .
- ( pt ) it is regrettable that the european parliament did not approve our proposal to reject this proposal for a directive , which prepares the ground for the patentability of computer programs , despite the fact that very many of the proposals for amendments to this directive were adopted .
new and creative it businesses in europe are right not to see the legal aspects that are involved as part of their core business .
applying for , and obtaining , patents is an expensive business .
france télécom &apos;s inability to finance its growth other than through debt has made matters worse . &quot;
the result is easy to foresee : small and medium-sized enterprises and independent programmers will be throttled .
greater protection for patents would enhance the large service providers &apos; position of strength in the market and would consequently mean that software developers would have to pay fees , in other words , royalties , for a wide variety of standard functions .
the attempt to create greater legal certainty by means of this directive is to be welcomed , but , in this instance , it misses the mark .
it is primarily consumers and software users who feel their effects .
&quot; credit ratings are used by investors as indications of the likelihood of repayment in accordance with the terms on which they invested .
mr president , i , too , voted against this draft directive , which i find bitterly disappointing .
this is a great disappointment , especially for consumers .
( pt ) the european parliament took an important step towards greening european union energy taxation today , by giving the green light to the directive restructuring the community framework for the taxation of energy products and electricity .
i am sure that the thinking behind the rapporteur &apos;s amendment was that it would benefit the environment if higher fuel prices were to deter consumers from using their own cars .
i hope the council &apos;s reaction will now be equally constructive , and that there will not be a repeat of the veto which precluded any revision of this very same piece of legislation in 1997 .
the market test has , to a large extent , welcomed the severing of the structural links between the parties .
the battle to protect the environment and stop environmental dumping must be fought with appropriate legislation and effective enforcement .
moreover , it is not for the member states to judge whether the prudent investor test has been met , but for the commission under the watchful eye of the community courts .
p had initially said it was not incorporating any extraordinary support from the french government into its rating when it downgraded france télécom &apos; s ratings to bbb in june .
nor can it dissociate the strategic decisions taken by a company from its operational decisions .
the bottom line is that we should not pollute at all .
according to the guidelines , &quot; aid for restructuring raises particular competition concerns . &quot;
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i voted in favour of the jonckheer report , as we now need to make it possible to at last give favourable tax treatment to non-food crops .
eligible customers have the choice between remaining supplied within a public utility contract by their historic gas supplier ( their rdc or the public utility wholesaler , mol wmt if the customer was supplied directly by mol wmt ) or terminating their public utility contract and purchasing their gas requirements from a trader or importing natural gas themselves .
this council compromise , therefore , constitutes a significant step in that direction , since it has brought agreement on a comprehensive energy tax directive , encompassing all forms of energy .
( pt ) the commission has wanted to create a community framework for the taxation of energy products for some time .

. ( pt ) i voted in favour of this report , because the aim of the financial framework on the table ( for 2002-2007 ) is to pursue a consumer protection policy , particularly by financing consumer information projects .
in its analysis of the company &apos;s fundamentals , the latter agency took into account ( i ) the fact that france télécom was the largest french fixed and mobile telephony operator ; ( ii ) the possible privatisation of the company ( &quot; ft &apos;s path from government entity to private corporation &quot; ; ( iii ) in the section entitled &quot; government seen as supportive , &quot; the fact that &quot; the french government has consistently stated its support for ft and its willingness to provide financial support if required , thereby addressing potential liquidity concerns .
however &quot; what is the market price for , say , 10 bn of new debt to a bbb- credit ?
we concur with the huge criticism that has been directed against making the concept of the patent too wide , something that would be downright damaging and mean that the wealth of invention would be reduced .
consequently , we have voted in favour of amendments aimed at narrowing down the concept of the patent .
eur 72 million have been allocated to this end .
i believe , nevertheless , that the delivery of this support should be expeditious , not encumbered by bureaucracy , and that direct assistance to national consumer organisations , including cooperatives , should not be excluded .
it must be said that this constraint appeared at a late stage , in so far as the company had , up to that time , the means with which to refinance itself and had , moreover , introduced substantial financing measures , including jumbos .
the divestiture of mol &apos;s 25 % shareholdings in mol storage and mol wmt pursuant to the commitments removes the concerns stemming from the structural links between mol and e.on.
ldcom proposes prohibiting the temporal or price squeeze on unbundling , imposing on wanadoo an obligation to supply third parties for internet retailing , increasing the profitability of alternative networks by increasing the prices of incoming interconnection and reserving for competitors the benefit of public subsidies within the framework of the deployment of networks in low-profitability areas .
a report by jp morgan dated 2 december 2002 also seems to confirm that , without the state &apos;s support , france télécom would not have been capable of obtaining fresh capital on the market in order to refinance its debt .
the text submitted to the igc is a broad and profound compromise .
our unity has thus become an essential tool in the service of peace .
nor can any nationalist neuroses make us forget how valuable european unity is for governing europeans , and , of course , for curbing the supremacy - and very often the stupidity - of other parts of the world .
the argument to the effect that the french authorities &apos; declarations as from july 2002 are aid is therefore innovative , but probably not without foundation .
i do not believe , mr president , that european diplomats can do any better in little more than two months .
two of the constitution &apos;s fundamental pillars of governance are the subsidiarity principle and the environmentally responsible market economy .
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , although europe is becoming more democratic , more transparent , and closer to its people , it has certainly not finished with this constitutional treaty .
that fact alone gives us the mettle to champion it , and to convince the citizens to confer on it the title &apos; constitution for europe &apos; .
for example , france télécom has set up a joint venture with deutsche telekom and enel in italy .
in addition , e.on controls various companies involved in electricity retail supply in neighbouring countries .
whilst moody &apos;s concerns regarding the overall level of financial risk and particularly ft &apos;s weak liquidity position remain , moody &apos;s has grown more comfortable with expectation that the french government will act in a supportive manner , if ft started to encounter difficulties with its debt repayment schedule &quot; ( emphasis added ) .
p ... downgraded france télécom &apos;s ratings to bbb- ... the agency no longer expects france télécom to hit the 3,5 × net debt / ebitda target by 2003 , but did assign a &quot; stable &quot; outlook to the low triple b ratings .
will voters have direct influence on the decisions of the council ?
are they able to directly elect the commissioners ?
john palmer , of the respected european policy centre , and numerous german provincial prime ministers of varying political colours , have for years been saying over and over again , that if a country were constituted in the same way as the european union , it would not be able , by reason of its lack of democratic legitimacy , to qualify as a member state of the eu .
will the european parliament become fully representative of the people ?
ministry of finance press release of 12.9.2002 .
the hungarian electricity sector is also characterised by a hybrid model , including a regulated segment and an open segment .
bouygues telecom also refers , in its comments of 11.4.2003 , p . 14 , to the recourse to erap in order to carry out the support operation and to the various laws concerning it , such as , for example , the law on the modification of its statutes or the granting of an explicit guarantee .
the german and greek legislatures have similar arrangements .
the second definition is clearly not relevant in the present case .
will it bring about the unmistakeably clear separation of powers ?
which draft , though , do we see before us ?
mol owns the gas transmission network , all hungarian gas storage facilities and has a quasi-monopoly position on the gas wholesale markets .
we leave them to the judgment of our peoples .
the fact that only the members of the european united left ( 45 ) voted in favour of these amendments , while 420 voted against and 68 abstained , demonstrates just how hypocritical they all are ; while they are making a great show of fighting for the rights of the iraqi people , they bless its occupation , oppression and plundering in practice .
we do not want to see a situation where a limitless patent system can be abused by large operatives to stifle technical competition or , even worse , prevent the publication of information .
france télécom has enjoyed an advantage which afors télécom estimates is worth eur 1,5 billion .
mention is made here only of criteria applicable to a company in the telecommunications sector .
immediate liquidity issues are solved : since the government &apos;s upfront prepayment of its € 15bn equity offering in the form of a € 9bn standby facility , ft has been able to re-access the debt capital markets to solve its immediate liquidity challenges . &quot;
however , in the end i voted against the report .
similarly , &quot; the solution adopted in the crédit foncier de france case - assuming it is in keeping with community law , which is not certain as the decision has not been the subject of an appeal - relates to radically different circumstances . &quot;
( pt ) it beggars belief that the european parliament should , in its first statement following the invasion of iraq by the united states and its allies , adopt a recommendation which , due to the rejection of an amendment tabled by my group , fails to recall - to paraphrase our amendment - that the present unstable situation , which represents a threat to the iraqi people and the international community , is a consequence of the unjust , illegitimate and illegal attack launched by the governments of the united states , the united kingdom and other countries on 20 march 2003 .

mrs berès , as you know , the decision is taken by the conference of presidents .
see article 1181 of the french civil code , which provides that &quot; an obligation contracted under a condition precedent is one which depends either on a future and uncertain event , or on an event having presently happened , but still unknown to the parties . &quot;
according to an article in the financial times of 15.1.2003 : &quot; ft will today settle investor doubt about its cash flow situation in 2003 by raising € 5,5 billion in the bond market ... it would now have all the cash it needs to honour € 15 billion of debts that falls due for repayment this year ... ft also faces € 35 billion of debt repayments in 2004 and 2005 . &quot;
in this respect , the commission is not able at this stage to precisely quantify the aid in question .
paragraph 1.8 talks of the need to set up a multinational military force and a police force mandated by the united nations , in cooperation with ? ? ? ? , on the basis of a &apos; political timetable &apos; , thereby repeating the &apos; bosnia-herzegovina &apos; argument ( six-month timetable , now ten years old ) ;
it proposes making the iraqi people a ward of the international community until it is old enough for democracy .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i would like to urge you most earnestly to adopt the recommendations drawn up by the committee on foreign affairs , human rights , common security and defence policy .
they are about finding a solution to the problem of how we help the people of iraq in the aftermath of war , and that of the competences of the united nations , which must progressively take over the leadership in this area in order to be able to permanently stabilise the region .
we owe it to the people there to look to the future rather than perpetuating old disputes , and so i would recommend that you reject all the amendments , with the exception of mr sakellariou &apos;s on the international court of justice , which i recommend that we adopt .
the main barrier faced by new entrants in hungary is the difficulty of access to competitive sources of gas , and the lack of liquidity of the hungarian gas wholesale market .
there is no further debate today .
mol storage is the only company able to offer gas storage services in hungary .
i believe that , in requiring unanimity for constitutional amendments of minor importance too we would certainly be closing the door to future developments .
the third point concerns linguistic and cultural diversity and the rights of minorities , referred to in amendment no 22 , recital h. i believe that the minorities that were referred to in the copenhagen criteria should have a place in this report as well .
the state still holds the majority of france télécom &apos;s capital .
the commission can accept all the amendments .
the magnox power plants are operating on the very competitive great britain electricity market .
the commission has also analysed the competition situation of each of the types of assets that the nda will continue to operate commercially .
the european parliament wants the member states to implement this directive swiftly , as , when they do , its benefits for the public and business will be indisputable .
before entering into a detailed analysis of the competition situation for each of the assets , the commission has two general remarks concerning the impact of the measure on competition .
only necessary costs will be paid for , with annual caps .
an immediate opening up of the market would create substantial problems relating in particular to the security of supply of electricity .
the commission concludes that the measures proposed by the united kingdom authorities are appropriate to address the combination of objectives pursued and are fully in line with the objectives of the euratom treaty .
right from the outset i have promoted the policy whereby public documents are of universal use and belong to everyone .
in which year that will happen none of us know , but this is one small step in that direction .
the derogation may be withdrawn by the commission if substantial changes occur in the electricity sector of the republic of cyprus .
i particularly want to draw attention to some things that are in the compromise and some things that , quite properly , are no longer there .
regulation ( ec ) no 951 / 97 authorises aid of up to 55 % for investments outside objective 1 regions .
it must be noted that , in contrast to what the commission believed at the time of the opening of procedure , this undertaking bears no relationship with the letter of comfort which was approved by the commission under state aid case n 34 / 90 .
i am grateful to the rapporteur for the way in which he has accommodated this .
it is right that libraries , museums , universities and other archives , which would have been covered in the original proposal , are now excluded from the directive .
indeed , transparency on the part of the public sector is a good thing for democracy , and democracy comes free of charge in europe .
in order to analyse whether the measure includes state aid to bnfl and / or to the nda , the commission first assessed whether it provided an advantage to these entities .
otherwise , i commend to you mr van velzen &apos;s work and the compromise for which my group will happily vote .
the commission presented an ambitious proposal ; but a number of member states evidently have little interest in it .
the directive should lead to the emergence of an active trade in public sector information in the european union , as in the united states .
on the other hand , it is in the nda &apos;s interest to be conservative to get sufficient funding for its activities , especially in a period of budgetary restrictions .
there is no mention of incorporating environmental concerns into the current debate on the review of the tens and there is no sign of any intention to carry out a pre-emptive environmental assessment .
in such cases , the legal liability to cover these costs is created periodically , normally on a yearly basis , as a counterpart for the operation of the plant .
competition concerns are therefore limited to thorp &apos;s lwr spent fuel reprocessing activities .
if the commission really is going to take its decisions by 1 october , it will not have time to do so ; it will merely have time to ratify the van miert list , which boils down to nothing more than the product of bartering between different governments .
in this regard , and as confirmed by the court of justice , nuclear safety is a community competence which must be linked to the protection against the dangers arising from ionising radiations laid down in article 30 , chapter 3 of the euratom treaty , relating to health and supply .
we must therefore endeavour to achieve about 30 or 40 % in non-returnable funds ; we must aim not just at eur 600 million per year but at achieving between eur 6 billion and eur 8 billion per year for the next ten years .
i believe that all the individual states would like this project to be important in terms of the expansion of their economies , of job creation , of attempting to create a genuine network across the 15 nations , soon to be 25 .
on the other hand , what we are attempting to do - and i would express my appreciation to the commission here for its endeavours - is , thanks to the work of the van miert high level group , review the ten objectives and , in particular , the resources .
i cannot list them all , so i will confine myself to mentioning the 10 major trans-european corridors planned and the fact that these infrastructures have essentially been assessed , first and foremost , with reference to the present european union rather than the future eu , in the sense that a great deal of pressure has been exerted by the countries who are already members while those who are , in any case , already knocking at the european union &apos;s doors had no bargaining power , with the result that we are now essentially in a position where we do need to consider their needs .
that said , i have to note that this evening &apos;s debate is based principally on the work of the van miert group and , in particular , on the priorities which have been set according to criteria which , in my opinion , need to be analysed in depth .
the required investments will place on eca an extra burden that would be a disadvantage compared to its competitors .
joined chambers of the court of cassation 500 / 1999 .
the uk government considered that this kind of management had reached its limits and that a new and more efficient method should be put in place in order for nuclear liabilities to be more efficiently handled , while preserving the highest level of safety .
otherwise , we will continue to hold virtually useless debates like this and , above all , we will continue to raise the expectations of our citizens and of some of our political leaders too , and it would and will be more damaging to fail to meet those expectations than to fail to implement a project .
meetings between the united kingdom authorities and the commission took place on 20 april , 25 august and 11 october 2005 .
indeed , in such a case , the spread of the pollution costs between the successive owners also drives the spread of the potential advantage granted by the state to each of them .
it must be noted however that , in many member states with a nuclear industry , the question of successive owners of plants is theoretical since all plants have always been owned by a single operator .
according to the information available to the commission , bnfl did not intend to reprocess it all .
eur 7 per test , for tests carried out in bovine animals referred to in annex iii to regulation ( ec ) no 999 / 2001 ;
however , the commission considers that the power to make this decision lies solely with the countries concerned and is immaterial to the community state aid policy .
the commission is aware that estimates for future revenue from the sellafield site can be controversial .
conditions for imports of cold-water ornamental fish
total liabilities to be funded by bnfl
if we do not adopt measures between now and 2010 to rationalise the use and maximise the benefits of each means of transport , the volume of heavy road traffic alone in the 15-member state union could increase by 50 % on the 1998 level .
consequently , what is urgently needed is for proclamations and all these plans on paper to find some response in reality .
other ( non-magnox and non-agr ) liabilities in springfields are allocated on a time proportion basis .
the estimated future cash flow for magnox plants takes account of the latest electricity prices in great britain. electricity prices in britain were particularly high at the end of 2005 .
this decision shall apply to :
even in this case , these profits will be compared to international benchmarks in the sector .
( notified under document number c ( 2006 ) 4227 )
for the purpose of calculating amounts at march 2005 prices the united kingdom shall use the reference and discount rate published by the commission for the united kingdom , updating this rate every five years .
from 1996 until today , the tens have undoubtedly had their ups and downs .
the united kingdom gives a detailed list and assessment of the activities that will remain with bnfl .
the specific animal health conditions and model certificates for ornamental fish , should be drawn up in line with the conditions and certificates laid down in decision 2003 / 858 / ec , taking into account the specific use of these animals in the community , and animal health situation of the third country concerned , in order to prevent the introduction of disease that could cause significant impact to the farmed and wild fish stock in the community if introduced and allowed to spread .
smp only has two commercial competitors at present : areva and belgonucléaire .
the original of the certificate must be completed on the day of loading the consignment for exportation to the ec with an official stamp and signed by an official inspector designated by the competent authority .
so we shall jointly adopt a number of priority works .
the commission understands that greenpeace suggests that , should westinghouse continue its operations as a part of the bnfl , the historic as well as future ties between bnfl and the nda might result in a cross-subsidisation from the nda to westinghouse .
the presidency &apos;s speech focused more on the functioning of the internal market than on the achievement of sustainability goals , and the same applies to the members &apos; speeches : they all talked about transport ; no one mentioned sustainability .
greenpeace also questions the nature of the future relationship between bnfl and the nda .
members who are no longer capable of contributing effectively to the group &apos;s deliberations , who resign or who do not comply with the conditions set out in paragraph 3 of this article or article 287 of the treaty may be replaced for the remainder of their term of office .
that is why no further pressure should be placed upon available speaking time .
it is not quite clear to me why , in fact , we are now debating the issue once again .
the commission however believes that this should not be a reason to deviate in the allocation method , since even if the global activity of the plants is decreased , the overall profile of their revenue generation ( that is , with most of the revenues generated in the beginning ) should remain the same .
or do you really believe that this house would be willing to give the commission a negotiating mandate that goes beyond our own existing common policies ?
furthermore , the government has provided generous incentives to potential investors in renewable energy sources notably for wind , photovoltaic and biomass capacity .
bilateral agreements can of course sometimes be helpful , but they should not be a substitute for a multilateral approach .
i think some caution is called for here from a european point of view .
the certificates shall be produced by the competent authorities of the exporting country .
this will have serious financial and technical implications for the member states .
having regard to council directive 2000 / 75 / ec of 20 november 2000 laying down specific provisions for the control and eradication of bluetongue &#91; 1 &#93; , and in particular article 8 ( 3 ) thereof ,
if you do not take that principle into account properly when preparing for negotiations , the risk of failure in the future will remain fairly high .
for that reason my advice - if we are not to shelve things but draw the necessary conclusions now - is that we should carry out a careful analysis and debate matters , and then reach a decision in as consensual way as possible about what the next steps should be .
other commission officials with an interest in the proceedings may attend meetings of the group and its sub-groups .
the decrease in 2003 was primarily due to restructuring the clean-up programme to focus on its core mission and accelerating clean-up .
as far as the peace clause is concerned , let me remind you that it expires at the end of the year in any case .
oj c 315 , 21.12.2004 , p . 4 .
genuine free movement of goods and passengers depends on a perfectly integrated transport network , which links the islands and outer or remote regions with central regions .
according to greenpeace , nuclear energy entails very significant risks for the environment .
having regard to council directive 91 / 67 / eec of 28 january 1991 concerning the animal health conditions governing the placing on the market of aquaculture animals and products &#91; 1 &#93; , and in particular article 19 ( 3 ) , article 20 ( 3 ) and article 21 ( 1 ) thereof ,
the inclusion of a section dedicated to the trans-european networks policy in the maastricht treaty gave the european community the powers and instruments it needed to develop them .
in this respect , the commission also stresses that it can find no a priori reason to believe that slc contracts , even with bnfl , will entail cross subsidy .
operators aim at recovering if possible all decommissioning costs from the revenue generated by these contracts .
our fear is that , in this way , the commission is covering up the misdeeds of the member states and , in so doing , acting unlawfully itself .
as it constitutes a development of provisions of the schengen acquis .
i am extremely pleased that mr cashman is expressing a wise position - one which mrs schörling has also put forward and with which i agree .
( 3 ) &#91; ihn &#93; are known to be present
we all know this , but it has probably not percolated right down through the organisation and to the people. i am convinced that it will happen , but we have a responsibility to give some impetus to the process .
aid within the meaning of article 87 ( 1 ) of the ec treaty - application of the polluter-pays principle .
decommissioning and waste management constitute an important part of the life-cycle of the nuclear industry , giving rise to risks which have to be responsibly addressed , and of the costs covered by the sector .
mr president , i , too , would like to thank mr cashman both for his excellent report and for succeeding in bringing to plenary an extremely important report containing essential provisions with almost unanimous support .
i do not believe that we would in that way obtain increased openness and greater access to documents .
the commission notes the united kingdom &apos;s microeconomic arguments that the measure , even if it decreased the plants &apos; srmcs , would not impact the time during which competitors run their plants and the price at which they sell their electricity .
the commission appreciates however that closing down these power plants immediately might have a negative impact on the efficiency and safety of the decommissioning operations .
analysis under the second reference system ( pollution costs as operating costs ) .
we have also developed a friendship .
openness and access to documents is , however , a long way from just being a question of giving people formal rights .
certain expressions must be defined more clearly so that they cannot be misused , for example concepts such as the overarching general interest and issues that are sensitive in terms of the legislative process .
one such area , which we have discussed at length , is the sensitive issue of the statements from the institutions &apos; legal services .
for a summer season trade at the prevailing wholesale market price in the wholesale market and at the end of that period such offers have not been accepted ( test a ) ; or
it is necessary to set forth technical specifications on the standards for biometric features used for the development of the vis so that member states can take preparatory actions for connecting their national systems to the central visa information system .
the eu and its institutions are sometimes very distant from the people .
at the last meeting of the interinstitutional committee , we discussed possibly producing material showing the successful work that has been done and the opportunities available to the public .
i hope that we shall be more successful and manage to make the institutions people-oriented .
we are beginning to see a growing debate , but the institutions appear still not to have succeeded in fully turning this increased interest to good effect .
there is clearly now at last an increasing interest in eu issues around europe .
this implies that any impact of the measure on competitors would decrease and end soon .
in terms of their content , the points have already been explained by mrs maij-weggen , who has once again gone into a lot of detail , this time in listing the information she possesses about who refuses access to documents - too little information on her part in the case of &apos; who &apos; - where and when this has happened , and about who is requesting such access .
journalists have come to believe that they might as well be looking for needles in haystacks as trying to find the documentation they need .
according to yesterday &apos;s frankfurter allgemeine newspaper , &apos; nothing is more exciting to the public than what is supposedly not there &apos; .
whereupon , the information enters the public realm through other routes and becomes , sometimes justifiably and sometimes completely unjustifiably , the subject of scandal .
the commission practice is to interpret the text of article 87 ( 3 ) ( c ) as meaning that a measure can be found compatible with the treaty where its positive contribution to the fulfilment of certain community objectives outweighs its negative impact on competition on the internal market .
replies from the united kingdom to comments from interested parties
for the sake of simplification , for the community border inspection posts , for european ornamental fish industry , as well as for third country trading partners , those animal health conditions and model certificates should be harmonised .
the way it works is that , even if you have something and nothing in the way of information - just a clue as to a book &apos;s title or an author &apos;s name - you arrive at the relevant page and are immediately told : &apos; customers who bought this book also bought ? &apos;
they are really very well managed , to the point of being childproof , youthproof and , if you like , with a guaranteed future .
mr cashman and i have worked together on openness a great deal in recent years .
the commission has previously so ruled with regard to aid 715 / 1999 , letter sg ( 2000 ) d / 105754 dated 2 august 2000 .
guidance for completing part i of the certificates
that leads to unequal treatment , with significant restrictions regarding documents of member states who themselves hardly have any legislation on openness .
name ( in capitals ) :
the nda would be expected not only to make decommissioning safer and more efficient but also to pave the way for a real nuclear decommissioning market .
if i may , mrs maij-weggen , i would like , together with the members , to thank you for your work in the european parliament over the past few years .
the compression format to be used is wsq .
i personally incline more to the &apos; aggressive journalist &apos; tendency , and , in my professional life , have found , rather , that you only get anywhere by going straight to the point and really piling on the pressure .
i think , therefore , commissioner , that we have to set to work in particular on extremely user-friendly computer programs .
in my opinion , there is still room for improvement there .
all nuclear plants operators should cover in principle their proper share of nuclear liabilities under the polluter pays principle .
it is therefore necessary to first establish a benchmark for normal costs to be borne by a company in order to analyse later whether the state is paying part of these costs .
liabilities discharged by bnfl
otherwise , it will be impossible for people to acquaint themselves with such a process .
since the state will pay for part of these costs , these payments should be considered as granting an advantage to the polluters .
i am grateful that commissioner de palacio emphasised this , together with the fact that a uniform and coordinated electronic case handling system is needed , whereby cases might be monitored throughout the whole process .
more and more documents have been put in the public domain .
that is an example of tremendous citizens &apos; participation in legislation .
in the light of the importance of an effective implementation of the increased monitoring to assess the prevalence of bse in ovine animals , it is appropriate to increase the amount per test to be reimbursed to the member states by the community up to a maximum amount of eur 30 per rapid test performed in ovine animals , in line with the cost per rapid test performed in caprine animals .
i look forward to continued cooperation on the implementation of this programme , as has been the case in the past .
we - all three institutions - are working on the proposed regulation setting up a european network and information security agency , and we will have the opportunity to come back to this issue in one of the next part-sessions .
greenpeace adds that the nda will probably be creating new waste with its operations , and that it is not clear whether it will set aside monies to pay for waste management .
modinis is the financial instrument to monitor , benchmark and disseminate these best practices .
this aspect of the company &apos;s comments , though not easy to interpret , seems to suggest that only measures that are not necessary for or that go beyond what is necessary for achieving the objectives of the euratom treaty can be analysed under the ec treaty .
the second pillar is then the ist programme - the information society technology programme , whose task is to guarantee that we will have state-of-the-art technologies and applications available in europe .
the group shall be chaired by the member of the commission responsible for multilingualism .
the third pillar is the one which binds these two together .
it is therefore necessary to define the technical standards that will allow meeting these requirements of quality and reliability .
this parliament has contributed to the adoption of this regulatory framework which entered into force last summer .
to indicate the sort of actions that are going to be financed in order to reach the goals set out in the programme , it covers things such as data collection , a revised set of benchmark indicators , studies to identify good practices in europe , workshops and studies , looking in particular at the adjustment of industry to the structural change generated by digital technologies and the transformation of society .
one interesting activity which is of particular value is the support of the information society forum , consisting of web-based experts and looking at challenges facing the development of the information society and , of course , the normal programme of targeted conferences , seminars and workshops .
sequencing
i welcome mrs maij-weggen &apos;s opinion and recommendations and , in particular , her view that the european ombudsman should give an assessment of the regulation : how it is working and how the exemptions are applied .
there are a number of sensitive documents which have not been registered with the institutions .
thus it can be counted as a contribution by bnfl towards meeting the nuclear liabilities for which it had assumed complete responsibility .
there have been some criticisms about the blanket refusal to give access to legal opinions .
under the first system , liability for funding the whole decommissioning cannot be avoided by the first owner .
in relation to the commission at least , which has a number of registers , i would also welcome the establishment of a single register , even if it is only a single doorway into the other registers .
i do not intend to use my full five minutes .
the next item is the report ( a5-0298 / 2003 ) by mr michael cashman , on behalf of the committee on citizens &apos; freedoms and rights , justice and home affairs , on public access to parliament , council and commission documents ( implementation of regulation 1049 / 2001 / ec in the year 2002 ) &#91; 2003 / 2022 ( ini ) &#93; .
thorp and smp liabilities allocated to bnfl
the situation for smp is different , since smp still has to contract most of its operations .
general access to public information is capable of releasing important impulses for growth , competitiveness and employment within the european union .
in this respect , it does not have any competitors at present .
with the help of public sector documents , new services and benefits may be generated in the it sphere .
this is the approach to clean-up that the nda is now committed to implementing .
the council and parliament have taken account of the corresponding reservations from first reading .
the public sector should be encouraged to make as many documents as possible available to citizens electronically , therefore .
it should be noted that this step did not change magnox electric &apos;s position as it was entitled to receive this money as a result of the first step .

if a particular authority no longer makes documents available or no longer updates them , its decision not to do so should be published as soon as possible .
this would give those affected a bigger safety margin in terms of planning .
let us protect ourselves against tendencies of that kind .
the long fought-for cross-border use of public documents is to be welcomed .

at the same time , we must pursue our own agricultural reforms convincingly , and continue to put the us under pressure to do the same .

thank you , commissioner lamy , for your open and direct cooperation with us .
mr president , commissioners , ladies and gentlemen , the general disappointment at the failure of the wto negotiations in cancún is evident , and the group of the european liberal , democrat and reform party too is of the opinion that this negative outcome is a missed opportunity .
apparently , the eu was even inflexible in the negotiations and this is why everything went wrong .
this illustrates , of course , that this was a geopolitical move more than anything else .
then there is the g-21 .
the argument that there would be no advantage for small- and mid-caps because funds and investors seek to maximize profits cannot be accepted since more favourable tax treatment enhances the attractiveness of such an investment , with increased liquidity for small- and mid-caps even in absence of any active behaviour by them aimed at benefiting from such an advantage .
on 1 may 2005 , the new legislation entered into force and replaced the regulation .
description of the scheme
however , the interests of the least developed countries have badly suffered as a result of this .
where do we go from here ?
in their letter dated 8 august 2005 , the slovene authorities describe in details the system put in place to monitor de minimis aid in slovenia .
the law of the jungle leaves no room for social and environmentally-friendly agriculture .
the wto , however , should first be reorganised towards this end .
further information was submitted to the commission by the slovene authorities on 7 november 2002 , 1 april 2003 , 16 may 2003 , 1 october 2003 , 4 february 2004 , 1 june 2004 , 17 september 2004 and 28 september 2004 .
there was , for the very first time , the prospect of the complete abolition of all forms of export promotion for a whole list of products of particular interest to the developing countries .
as far as the future is concerned , i take the view that we have to continue on our ambitious path , but that we must also take great care in evaluating , analysing and planning every step that we take along it .
the commission also confirms the view expressed in its letter opening the formal investigation procedure that the effect of the scheme in question is to favour small- and mid-caps whose shares are held by specialised investment vehicles benefiting from the tax reduction provided for in article 12 of decree-law no 269 / 2003 .
under article 4 of joint action 2005 / 557 / cfsp the council authorised the political and security committee to appoint the military advisor to the eusr upon a proposal from the secretary-general / high representative ( sg / hr ) based on a recommendation from the eusr .
however , any operating revenue accruing to investment vehicles is ordinarily subject to the 12,5 % substitute tax calculated on their net operating result .
we followed the discussions on agriculture .
we made concessions and ended up receiving nothing in return .
this will , without doubt , demand from all of us - both the industrialised and the developing countries - not only political will but also the willingness to compromise .
we were sat there and followed the negotiations between a number of protagonists , including the united states , the european union , the g-21 and the acp countries .
it also reduces the effective tax on the revenue of non-specialized investment vehicles participating in foreign specialised investment vehicles not subject to substitute tax in italy at a rate of 5 % .
the failure was certainly not their fault , and my group therefore emphatically refuses to vote against , even in this house , as if the european union and especially our commissioners were responsible for the stalemate .
see letter sg ( 2004 ) -greffe d / 203509 dated 13.8.2004 .
this raises questions that have already been addressed by the commissioner and the president-in-office of the council : why has cancún failed and where do we go from here ?
it is no coincidence that president bush &apos;s personal representative , robert zoellick , announced within minutes of the failure of cancún that the united states was going to forge ahead with the creation of the ftaa - the free trade area of the americas - and , in any case , with bilateral agreements .
how and where ?
we must place our trust in it and strengthen the historic , economic and commercial ties with latin america as a whole ; let us endeavour to include this objective in next year &apos;s agenda too .
it is an authoritative , democratic leadership , european in nature .
brazil - although only with regard to the agricultural dossier , for the moment - has , together with others , capably taken on leadership of the countries of the southern hemisphere , with the creation of the g-21 .
take the a58 following in a westerly direction until deltaweg ( a256 ) .
within two months of the date of notification of the present decision , the italian republic shall inform the commission of the identity of the beneficiaries , the amount of aid granted individually and the methods by which such amounts were determined .
european history teaches us that , in order to reach the rinascimento , the era of the flowering of civilisation , a common effort of creativity and political vision is needed .
legitimate interests are defined as the interest of private individuals in the correct use of power by the public authorities , as regards both expectations concerning the extension of their legal sphere ( interessi pretensivi - interests involving a claim on the authorities ) and the correct application of the procedural obligations imposed on them ( interessi procedimentali - procedural interests ) , in particular under the law on the publication of official acts .
on completion of the project-selection procedure , the competent authorities drew up a ranking list of the projects selected and informed the potential beneficiaries of their &quot; eligibility for financing &quot; by publishing the decision of the regional government approving the ranking list in the official journal of the region of veneto .
the commission takes the view that the regional authorities have no legal obligation as regards applications for financing considered to be eligible and entered on the ranking list published in the official journal of the region of veneto during the 1994-99 period and consequently there is no basis for a legitimate expectation by the undertakings concerned .
for the same motives , some african countries sought - they may have had no other choice - to take up a new , offensive position , promoting initiatives on themes such as cotton , for example , and further widening the gap between the positions on the traditional chapters .
as regards the commission &apos;s reservations concerning the use of agrimonetary aid and aid originating from overbooking referred to in point 31 of the letter initiating the procedure , the italian authorities state that :
this thread must be taken up again in accordance with wto rules and without this constituting a precedent for other negotiating chapters .
at this juncture , these three questions open up three debates .
of course , it is not yet wholly compromised , but its path has become more difficult , full of obstacles and , thus , of necessity , longer .
under article 87 ( 3 ) ( e ) of the treaty , categories of aid specified by a decision of the council acting by a qualified majority on a proposal from the commission may be considered compatible with the common market .
in accordance with article 87 ( 1 ) of the ec treaty , any aid granted by a member state or using state resources in any form whatsoever which distorts or threatens to distort competition by favouring certain undertakings or the production of certain goods is , in so far as it affects trade between member states , incompatible with the common market .
by letters of 11 november 2003 ( a / 37737 ) and 26 november 2003 ( a / 38138 ) , the italian authorities provided the information requested .
peace will come only when the palestinian people &apos;s inalienable and widely-acknowledged right to their own independent , sovereign state becomes reality .
the next item is the statement by the council and the commission on the outcome of the world trade organisation ministerial conference in cancún from 10 to 14 september 2003 .
it is therefore necessary , in this cooling-off phase , to ask ourselves a number of questions about the summit and the preparations we made for it .
this decision shall apply from the day following that of its publication in the official journal of the european union .
in the case in point , it is clear that the undertakings carried out the investments in question without the aid .
on the other , there are the singapore issues , the other issues relating to the governance of globalisation , which are a priority for europe and the major investor countries but which the developing countries feel are an invasion of their rights , which has led them - or some of them , at least - to create a kind of cultural exception too , at least for the time being .
it must further be noted that the limited impact of the measure may also be explained by the fact that the commission promptly initiated an investigation and opened the formal investigation procedure into the measure , and this may have influenced the behaviour of the operators .
both issues can be solved with imaginative thinking and money .
the international community needs to redouble its efforts to reconvene the roadmap to enable a two-state solution with a viable , contiguous state of palestine , based approximately on the 1967 borders , and a secure israel living in peaceful , neighbourly coexistence .
if the aid rate does not exceed 50 % of eligible investments in objective 1 regions and 40 % in the other regions ;
im landkreis darmstadt-dieburg die gemeinden erzhausen , weiterstadt , griesheim , pfungstadt , seeheim-jugenheim , alsbach-hähnlein , bickenbach
such a taxation system leads inherently to an incentive for the companies to act in a more environmentally friendly manner , by emitting less co2 .
mr president , the tragedy of the arab-israeli conflict is never too far from our minds or tv screens , and the carefully constructed roadmap now seems to have virtually imploded .
by decision 2006 / 591 / ec , the commission has amended decision 2005 / 393 / ec as regards the demarcation of restricted zones established following the notification of outbreaks of bluetongue by the competent authorities of the netherlands , germany and belgium .
case c-156 / 98 germany v commission &#91; 2000 &#93; ecr i-6857 , paragraphs 24 to 28 , and case t-93 / 02 confédération nationale du crédit mutuel v commission , judgment of 18 january 2005 , not yet reported , paragraph 95 .
on the contrary , we must use our joint goodwill and energy much more to help establish reconciliation and lasting peace .
concerning a request from the republic of lithuania to apply a reduced rate of vat to the supply of district heating
despite this , there still seems to be goodwill , as is evident , among other things , from the proposal to release a number prisoners from each side .
pursuant to article 10b of law no 77 / 1983 , revenue from foreign investment vehicles not governed by council directive 85 / 611 / eec is included in the net operating result as it is not subject to withholding tax .
the investment vehicles in question undertake collective investment in transferable securities including bonds , shares and other securities of listed and non-listed companies in the collective interest of third-party investors ( participants ) .
the european union should play a pioneering role , much more so than it has done to date .
i see this , though , as giving rise to three specific demands .
first of all , in the first phase of the roadmap , there is reference to the need to destroy the infrastructure of terror .
mr president , mr president-in-office of the council , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , in recent years , we have repeatedly given our very close attention to developments in the middle east , and i think there is consensus that we all want to do our bit to ensure that the roadmap to peace can be adhered to .
the special representative of the european union ( eusr ) for sudan inter alia ensures the coordination and coherence of the union &apos;s contributions to the african union mission in the darfur region of sudan ( amis ) .
most intifadas are popular and peaceful intifadas .
i do not think that is enough .
however , on the basis of the same information and analysis , the commission accepted that it could have been possible to deliver four of the ships .
the central register was established before the accession of slovenia to the eu .
in addition , the italian authorities stated that , although the measure involved the 1994-99 programming period , the compatibility of the projects concerned with the common market had to be evaluated on the basis of the &quot; community guidelines for state aid in the agriculture sector &quot; ( hereafter referred to as &quot; the guidelines &quot; ) , since the state aid scheme was notified after the entry into force of those guidelines .
in this , we should not merely make declarations , but take the appropriate action .
lastly , the measures in question must be examined in the light of article 87 ( 3 ) ( c ) of the treaty , which stipulates that aid to facilitate the development of certain economic activities or of certain economic areas , where such aid does not adversely affect trading conditions to an extent contrary to the common interest is admissible .
department of haute-marne : arrondissements of saint-dizier , chaumont
they also pointed out that the requirements under annex ii to the agreement on agriculture concluded during the uruguay round of multilateral trade negotiations would be respected since neither producers nor processors would be paid any form of direct aid and the measures would not have the effect of price support. given that the programme concerned fundamental research , it would not directly affect agricultural or agri-food production .
in addition , the legitimate expectation that arose when the application was submitted was reinforced when the applicant was entered on the list of undertakings eligible for financing .
there is therefore a communication problem , and there may also be some linguistic confusion , which we must clear up if we are to do justice to the remarkable strength of european civil society , which has to express itself first and foremost - although not solely - through its representative organs .
somebody pointed out that the non-governmental organisations played a dual , perhaps ambiguous role , changing between the language spoken in brussels or strasbourg and the , at times , loud shouting at cancún , and that , at the same time , the european union and the commission had difficulty in putting across how much europe has done over these 22 months and how much it does every day for the weakest of the weak .
in particular it stipulates that , as of the tax year in which certain conditions are met , the net operating result of those undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities that are specialised in shares of small- and mid-caps listed on a regulated market in the european union ( specialised investment vehicles ) are subject to a 5 % tax , instead of the standard 12,5 % rate of tax .
i believe it is our duty to take your comments to the european council , particularly in preparation for and in the wake of our appointment on 15 december , in which we may succeed in gaining a better insight into the impact of this failure on the other players too , including those who , perhaps unwittingly , have rejoiced rather too soon at this failure .
lastly , although the number of eligible small- and mid-caps listed on regulated european markets is relatively large compared with the size of the tax reduction in 2004 , the information presented by italy does not indicate that the benefits accruing to any individual beneficiary fall within the limit for de minimis aid .
firstly , one of the issues being debated was whether a multilateral approach or bilateral agreements should have priority .
in my response i would like to concentrate on a few points that i think need to be explored further and also clarified somewhat .
comments from italy and interested parties
oj c 238 , 3.10.2002 , p . 14 ( state aid case n 843 / 01 ) .
the italian authorities stated that no aid would be granted to projects in contravention of any prohibitions or restrictions laid down in the common organisations of the market or that concerned the manufacture and marketing of products which imitated or substituted for milk and milk products .
madam president , i would first like to thank the commission &apos;s very professional negotiating team , commissioner fischler and commissioner lamy , because they really did everything in their power to make the conference a success .
a meaningful summary of that opening decision was published on 22 february 2005 in the official journal of the european union. all interested parties were invited to submit their comments within one month of the date of publication .
that is not something for us to be happy about .
mrs lucas said earlier that poorer countries should have the right to promote their own national industries .

although he is not listening to me , i would like to say to mr urso that i appreciated his frank reasoning and also much of his analysis .
this was a weaker area of the commission and parliament &apos;s work too .
on that basis , only 36 projects remain to be financed : even if financing could be granted under the new rural development plan for 2000-06 , it is not clear to which &quot; applications carried over from the previous &#91; ... &#93; programming period &quot; the italian authorities are referring to .
im kreis südwestpfalz die verbandsgemeinden wallhalben , waldfischbach-burgalben , thaleischweiler-fröschen , zweibrücken-land sowie die ortsgemeinden donsieders , clausen , leimen aus der verbandsgemeinde rodalben , die verbandsfreie gemeinde rodalben und die exklave zu wilgartswiesen in der verbandsgemeinde rodalben
furthermore , the voices of the world &apos;s poorest countries , which enjoy completely free access to our markets as a result of the &apos; everything but arms &apos; initiative , were not even heard .
today &apos;s eu market , moreover , takes in 85 % of those countries &apos; agricultural exports .
this was due to the cap reform it has carried out , and the agreement it has concluded with the united states of america .
i therefore want to ask mr imbeni and the speakers following him on the list of speakers to excuse me , because i must now give the floor to commissioner lamy .
the failure of cancún demonstrates that the wto cannot play this role unimpeded , which is , without doubt , a good thing .
for the first time , the european union adopted an assertive stance , with which it seemed rather comfortable .
information by individual beneficiary
it is clear from the interview with mr lamy that he intends to sacrifice even more and i am waiting for an answer to the question of how far he will go .
the sellafield site , including in particular the thermal oxide reprocessing plant ( thorp ) and the sellafield mox plant ( smp ) .
these assets were built by bnfl .
together with the sites mentioned above , bnfl transfers to the nda a number of financial assets linked to these sites , which were set up in the past to fund at least in part their decommissioning .
the process , therefore , is clearly unsustainable .
to expect to sit down with 148 countries and reach any conclusion is beyond any possibility , but i believe that cancún was a watershed .
to me , cancún should have been the culmination of months of serious work in committee , thrashing out answers to the doubts and fears of the developing world .
the commission notes that the slovene authorities have structured the scheme on the basis of the environmental guidelines and the energy taxation directive .
but today i specifically want to speak in defence of the weaker developing countries , particularly those in the acp .
note : in all tables , totals may not exactly match the sums of items because of rounding .
from deltaweg ( a256 ) , follow in a northerly direction until the water .
sometimes it is a good thing to have several options , because you then have some scope for juggling your options .
on 19 december 2003 ( d / 58192 ) the commission again reminded italy of its obligations under article 88 ( 3 ) of the treaty and invited the italian authorities to inform those that might benefit from the incentives of the consequences provided for by the treaty and by article 14 of council regulation ( ec ) no 659 / 1999 if the incentives in question were found to constitute aid unlawfully implemented without the prior authorisation of the commission .
i think there is a lot in that .
madam president , mr president-in-office of the council , commissioners , ladies and gentlemen , i find myself in a similar position to mr daul , in that i too do not wish to repeat everything that has already been discussed , but i would like to say something about one comment made by the italian presidency .
we had a situation in seattle in which civil society tried , as part of anti-globalisation campaigns , to ask questions that we as a political institution have perhaps not always taken seriously enough or adequately addressed .
if , though , we conduct negotiations as if in a bazaar - &apos; you give me one thing , and i give you another &apos; , we should not be surprised when they fail .
as the information provided by the italian authorities was still incomplete , the commission again requested a number of further details by letter dated 23 november 2004 .
furthermore , according to those comments , the scheme would not affect competition because any european small- or mid-caps could benefit from the easier access to capital .
the resources were used up before all the projects on the ranking list could be financed .
on the basis of the information available to the commission , it was not in a position to establish full compliance with these four conditions , given that the italian authorities had not given any commitments , either on equal conditions for accessing the findings of the research or on compliance with the requirements under annex ii of the agreement on agriculture concluded during the uruguay round of multilateral trade negotiations ( there was evidence of compliance with other requirements ) .
we should also remember that the eu , in addition to being by far the biggest donor of development aid , buys , for example , 80 % of africa &apos;s agricultural exports .
to what extent opposition to the liberalisation of the cotton trade was responsible for the meeting &apos;s failure remains a mystery , but it certainly played a part .
the new information was assessed by another independent expert , who also came to the same conclusion as the commission .
this group , as has already been said here , probably did not have only trade goals , but also aims relating to power politics , as , for example , its opposition to real or imagined us unilateralism .
the aid amount that italy would grant to fincantieri if the commission were to extend the delivery limit for ship 6079 is approximately € 33 million ( 9 % of the contract value of the ship ) .
any revenue distributed by an investment vehicle subject to substitute tax in italy to its participants ( including other investment vehicles ) is not subject to further taxation under the general system .
part of the problem over cotton is connected with this .
other developed countries should also follow the eu &apos;s example and conclude &apos; everything but arms &apos; agreements , as we have done with 49 of the poorest countries .
to expect additional efficiency gains and time savings for each further ship is even less plausible for the last two ships in a series of five than in a series of three ships .
madam president , the failure of the mid-term review of the doha round at cancún was a defeat with regard to accelerating world economic growth .
for the interested parties , the scheme is aimed at fostering the market capitalisation of small- and mid-caps as opposed to other companies listed in europe and , as such , it would fall outside the scope of state aid monitoring .
it was also an undeserved defeat for us in the eu ; but above all it was a defeat for the developing countries .
the european union and the united states of america had reached consensus on a joint bid to lower agricultural trade barriers and subsidies , and an agreement on the introduction of generic drugs to improve medical care in the developing countries had been made .
the commission did not state in the decision initiating the formal procedure that such a method would be impossible , but underlined its complexity ; italy agrees with this and acknowledges that it was a &quot; less satisfactory method of construction . &quot;
in order to clarify the effects of the scheme and the way in which it indirectly extends the tax reduction to non-specialised vehicles and to other participants , it is necessary to examine separately the different tax rules applicable to capital revenues accruing to investment vehicles and to their participants , as amended by article 12 of decree-law no 269 / 2003 .
the conditions of article 51.1 ( b ) 1st indent of the guidelines on environmental protection are therefore satisfied for both categories of beneficiaries .
that is not , of course , to say that european agricultural protectionism is not ultimately so very different from that of the united states .
stadt zweibrücken
by letter of 24 february 2005 ( d / 51366 ) , the commission forwarded them to the italian authorities. by letter of 4 april 2005 ( a / 32813 ) , the italian authorities submitted their comments on those further comments by assogestioni .
in conclusion , it is imperative that the doha development round gets back on track if there is to be any hope of lifting millions in the developing world out of poverty .
accordingly , a community financial assistance should be granted to the community reference laboratories for brucellosis and foot-and-mouth disease .
in this i am convinced that the eu must take the initiative .
mr president , i share the views of the majority of the speakers here this afternoon that the collapse of the talks was a major blow , both to the wto itself and to the global economy .
without increased trade activity , global growth will slow down and global poverty will rise .
the council directive 2003 / 96 of 27 october 2003 on the taxation of energy products and electricity ( &quot; energy taxation directive &quot; ) , the directive 2003 / 87 / ec of the european parliament and council of 13 october 2003 establishing a scheme for greenhouse gas emission allowances trading within the community and amending council directive 96 / 61 / ec ( &quot; directive on emission trading &quot; ) , and the directive 2004 / 8 / ec of the european parliament and council of 11 february 2004 on the promotion of cogenerationhave entered into force on their respective days of publication .
in many ways the rules of the wto are not neutral ones that can be used defensively to protect the interests of the weakest players .
in its opening decision , the commission found this aid compatible with article 87 ( 3 ) ( c ) of the ec treaty .

he also gave me vital advice and support in the establishment of the ombudsman institution in greece .
other important achievements include the code of good administrative behaviour approved by a resolution of this house in 2001 , a procedural code for complainants under the article 226 infringement procedure adopted by the commission last year , and the abolition of age limits in recruitment to the institutions and bodies .
when the previous act is that hard to follow , one has to pull out all the stops ; i am sure , though , that mr diamandouros &apos;s performance will be a triumph .

the issue is thus one of balancing the need for transparency with the confidentiality required in dialogues between the commission and the member states .
council decision 2006 / 670 / cfsp
if the igc adopts the convention &apos;s text on this issue , we might then have a legal basis for launching an initiative promoting a common code for all the institutions , involving a codecision procedure with parliament &apos;s full participation. i would remind you , however , that matters as they stand are governed by article 308 of the treaty .
nothing more than a simple opinion - and a unanimous one at that - would thus be required of the european parliament at the moment. with this in mind , it is important to await the final results of the igc before taking definitive steps in this regard .

in so doing , the commission has followed the procedure set out in article 5 of that regulation and in article 8 of commission regulation ( ec ) no 1663 / 95 of 7 july 1995 laying down detailed rules for the application of council regulation ( eec ) no 729 / 70 regarding the procedure for the clearance of the accounts of the eaggf guarantee section &#91; 7 &#93; .
the proposal has not moved forward , and we have not obtained the necessary guarantees of the ombudsman &apos;s access to all documents .

i believe it would be quite excellent if the new ombudsman could investigate the relations between the auditing and supervisory bodies and see whether they fulfil the requirements of good administration and adequate transparency .
since those provisions follow the same principles as articles 31 and 32 of council regulation ( ec ) no 1260 / 1999 of 21 june 1999 laying down general provisions on the structural funds &#91; 5 &#93; , which are referred to in the act of accession of bulgaria and romania , the specific financial provisions provided in annex viii to the act of accession are no longer necessary .

valle strona : the water catchment area of the river strona from its sources in the municipality of camandona to the barrier near vallemosso in locality rovella ,
we are nonetheless all agreed that , before enlargement , we must make progress in dealing with petitions , especially at the beginning of the work , and grasp the hand of cooperation extended by the ombudsman about a year ago .
one thing that worries me are the cases when complaints to the commission , on the basis of article 226 , and petitions to the committee concern the same sets of circumstances .
those zones should therefore no longer appear in decision 2002 / 308 / ec as zones free of vhs .
of course , differences and divisions do exist. however , rather than ignoring them , the committee on petitions has shown itself capable of overcoming them to find practical ways forward .
they are constantly striving to improve their internal organisation so as to respond to the needs of the petitioners. i am sure all those present in the house today will be aware that my group and i are not inclined to mince our words when it comes to the european commission .

the community grants financial contribution to sweden for the functions and duties provided for in article 32 of regulation ( ec ) no 882 / 2004 , to be carried out by the statens veterinärmedicinska anstalt ( sva ) , uppsala , sweden , for the monitoring of campylobacter .
i would not presume to lecture the house on the many objectives contained in existing and draft treaties .
i should therefore like to take the opportunity provided by this latest overview to stress that this committee is the best indicator of a number of the difficulties experienced by citizens. it serves as a channel through which citizens can make us aware of their concerns and expectations .
the water catchment areas of the following rivers from their source to the sea :
i do not consider that 2005 is remotely good enough .
we have waited far too long to get this code and if the commission would only adopt it , i am sure many of the problems the institutions currently face could be resolved .
for the period from 1 july 2006 to 31 december 2006 , that financial contribution shall not exceed 98000 eur .
all continental and coastal areas within its territory .
i look at the empty seats over there and see that the council appears not to be interested either in the work of the ombudsman or in the work of the committee on petitions .
a progress report covering the first three months of the survey shall be forwarded by 28 february 2007. the progress report should contain all information requested in annex iii of the opinion of the scientific panel on biological hazards on the request from the commission related to &quot; risk assessment and mitigation options of salmonella in pig production . &quot;
furthermore , the pension was back-paid to 1995 , so that was a very welcome addition to his income .
there is a german citizen currently living in my constituency who thought that he was entitled to a pension from the german government. it refused to pay .
it was only after petitioning this parliament that they got that allowance .
the draft tsi has been examined by the committee set up by council directive 96 / 48 / ec of 23 july 1996 on the interoperability of the trans-european high-speed rail system
lymph nodes shall be surface de-contaminated before analysis by dipping into absolute alcohol and drying by air .
having regard to council regulation ( eec ) no 729 / 70 of 21 april 1970 on the financing of the common agricultural policy &#91; 1 &#93; , and in particular article 8 ( 2 ) thereof ,
in 2000 mr justice cresswell pointed out that the catalogue of failings and incompetence in the 1980s by underwriters , managing agents , members &apos; agents , and others was staggering and brought disgrace on one of the city &apos;s great markets .
the method recommended by the community reference laboratory ( crl ) for salmonella in bilthoven , the netherlands , shall be used .
the commission has verified that the prs meets all criteria of the annex to directive 94 / 57 / ec other than those set out under paragraphs 2 and 3 of the &quot; general &quot; section a of that annex .
perhaps the commissioner can give us the figures - in particular with reference to the old liabilities at lloyd &apos;s that they sought to separate in the scheme known as equitas .
article 4 ( 6 ) : operational criteria for competent authorities
for instance i could mention consideration of the report on the monitoring of the implementation of community law. on that occasion , the committee on petitions twice requested the european commission to seek political solutions acceptable to all and in particular , to seriously consider the need to draw up proposals for the review of those community rules that are most often incorrectly implemented or appealed against .
the community &apos;s financial contribution should be at the rate of 100 % of eligible costs as defined in regulation ( ec ) no 156 / 2004 .
mr president , i should like to thank you for this new invitation to address the house and to provide you with the latest report on the progress of the commission &apos;s investigations into this complex and very sensitive file .
these guidelines lay down criteria for conducting the audits provided for in article 4 ( 6 ) of regulation ( ec ) no 882 / 2004 .
&quot; competent authorities shall carry out internal audits or may have external audits carried out , and shall take appropriate measures in the light of their results , to ensure that they are achieving the objectives of this regulation .
any insulating material of at least class e-d2 in case of gypsum boards of ≥ 9,5 mm nominal thickness and ≥ 600 kg / m3 core density .
from the beginning of our investigations into this complex and sensitive file , we have repeatedly made it clear to complainants that any action for damages must be undertaken before national courts .
therefore , in accordance with the relevant case-law of the court of justice , the task of the commission is to examine the compatibility of the new regime with the requirements of the insurance directives .
germany has notified that one farm located in schleswig-holstein has ceased its activity .
to that end , the audit process should :
statement on costs incurred on the survey and eligible for community financial contribution :
clearly , after a final decision , the commission will make documents available , subject to any remaining confidentiality constraints .
there are those who imply that , in the conduct of its enquiries , the commission has exposed itself to accusations of maladministration and unnecessary delay .
two press releases were issued and sent to all complainants and petitioners .
for this purpose , a change control management process has been devised to consolidate and update the requirements of annex a of the tsi .
furthermore , as i have just said , in accordance with the procedural safeguards for complainants , the commission services have written to all complainants informing them of the results of the commission &apos;s preliminary analysis and seeking their comments .
the catchment area of the brooks of velleches and of des trois moulins , from the sources to the dam of des trois moulins in the department of la vienne ,
there is an enormous discrepancy between the citizen and the giant .
council decision 2006 / 675 / cfsp
how can we not ask parliament , how can we not even ask ourselves what we should do to resolve this situation ?
amounts to be charged to the member states
this provision applies in 2006 to germany , spain , france , italy , austria and slovenia .
cases notified under regulation ( eec ) no 595 / 91 in which undue payments have been recovered in full or for which it has been found that no undue payment was made should be removed from the list of notifications provided for in articles 3 and 5 of that regulation .
i therefore do not intend to criminalise anybody .
sampling for the purpose of the survey in flocks of turkeys shall be organised by the member states and shall be performed from 1 october 2006 on holdings containing at least 500 fattening birds or 250 breeding birds .
there are now those who are calling for a committee of inquiry to be set up and those who oppose this , but it is not a problem that must be resolved in court , not least because we do not want to start legal proceedings , because we are not qualified to start proceedings and because we do not want there to be adverse parties .
mr president , it is very easy to react on emotion but this house should not react on emotion , it should react on facts .
appointing a new european union special representative for central asia
records and sample storage
i repeatedly pointed out that the way mr perry was trying to set up a committee of inquiry was not the correct way , was against the rules of procedure and , indeed , the treaties .
in order to optimise the benefits of transparency , it should be combined with balanced reporting , that is a proper mixture of verified compliance ( positive findings ) and areas for improvement ( negative findings ) .
the report states that directives have not been implemented .
zones in the united kingdom , the channel islands and the isle of man approved with regard to vhs
the pse group will vote in favour of his amendments .
these are just some concrete examples of changes that had to be made to a deeply flawed report .
auditor competence and selection criteria should be defined under the following headings :
any wood-based product with density ≥ 400 kg / m3 or any product of at least class a2-s1 , d0 or any insulating product of at least class e-d2 mounted according to method 1
mr president , along with many british members of this house , i have received a large number of personal letters from constituents like the petitioners in this case .
a minimum number of pigs , kept during at least the preceding three months in the member state , shall be ad random sampled in accordance with table 1 .
when deciding on such measures , the member states should balance the need for transparency against the risk of undermining the audit system &apos;s ability to achieve its objectives .
as a parliament we then called on the commission to improve its infringement procedures and its dealings with complainants , calling in particular for correspondence passing between the commission and the member states to be made available .
in so doing , it is not the intention to call into question the work of the commission in monitoring the proper application of eu law by the member states .

with the greatest respect to the commissioner - and i have the utmost respect for his work - to say that everything is in order now is not entirely satisfactory .

the petitioners and complainants invested in what they thought was a properly regulated market according to uk and eu law .
many investors were bankrupted , some committed suicide and we need to know why , who was at fault and why there was a delay in the implementation of european union law .
member states should ensure that competent authorities have sufficient implementing powers , and resources , with the appropriate authority , to establish , implement and maintain an effective audit system .
general guidance on the resources required for auditing is provided in iso 19011 .
in order to demonstrate the audit process is transparent , documented procedures should , in particular , include a clearly defined audit planning process , audit criteria and audit report approval and distribution mechanisms .
publication of final audit report
in conclusion , i urge this house to support mr perry &apos;s amended report and , until the due process has been exhausted , go no further .

that the two twin rights , of accusation and petition , are interlinked. they should not therefore be debated separately .
thus , we shall be reliable and we shall say that we really are interested in their rights .
the member states should adopt the appropriate measures to ensure their audit systems are transparent , taking national legal and other requirements into account .
now , what we are calling for , after five years , is a clear picture at least of what is going on .
so what we want is to obtain this clear picture in a short space of time because mr cashman may in fact be right .

that our concern at this moment in time is not the substance of the matter , nor are we a court .
i am seizing this opportunity to generalise this concern , because today we had the reports from the ombudsman and the committee on petitions .

the united kingdom has instructed its customs authorities to impound quantities of alcohol and cigarettes in excess of what it thinks is reasonable for personal consumption .
the role of the commission , as i have said time and again , is to see that present legislation is in line with present european law .
mrs wallis asked whether the commission is really the guardian of the treaties in this case .

i would simply ask you to confirm that the action of the house in receiving this report is fully in accordance with the rules of procedure and that it is acceptable .
it is the report that is important , but i would welcome your confirmation on that point .

the commission is not sitting on the fence , but it cannot go beyond the bounds of what it is allowed to do .
therefore it is necessary to harmonise the provisions on leader set out in annex viii to the act of accession of bulgaria and romania with the new provisions provided for in regulation ( ec ) no 1698 / 2005 .
therefore the matter of compensation for previous losses must be left to the national judicial authorities and , as has been remarked this morning , there is now a lawsuit which has been brought before the high court in london .
the original form , however , is not admissible .

it was a positive step that at second reading of this draft directive it was recognised that traditional practice in public sector bodies with regard to the use of public sector information has developed in very disparate ways , and this should therefore be taken into consideration .

independent scrutiny of the audit process
report ( a5-0203 / 2003 ) by roy perry , on behalf of the committee on petitions , on petitions declared admissible : the lloyd &apos;s petitions ( petitions 1273 / 1997 , 71 / 1999 , 207 / 2000 , 318 / 2000 , 709 / 2000 , and 127 / 2002 ) ( 2002 / 2208 ( ini ) )

mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , i would thank my colleague mr lisi for the report he has presented on the limitation of emissions of volatile organic compounds in paints , varnishes and vehicle refinishing products .
then there are many amendments relating to the thresholds , in other words the percentages proposed by the commission and changed by parliament in the committee on the environment , public health and consumer policy .
with regard to what is known as the substitution approach , set out in amendment no 23 , i do not believe it is applicable in this context , for the companies and the industrial system we are addressing need facts and certainties - which we are providing in this directive - precisely in order to be able to invest in research and develop the formulas necessary to achieve the objectives .
in chapter xi of decision 2005 / 873 / ec , article 11 ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) are replaced by the following :
in the environment , account is to be taken of effects upon photosynthesis .
in fact , the need to address the risks linked to the dangers arising from ionising radiation constitutes one of the major priorities of the nuclear sector .
volatile organic compounds ( vocs ) , in this case hydrocarbons , have a considerable part to play in the formation of ground-level ozone .

the high level group on multilingualism , hereinafter referred to as &quot; the group , &quot; is hereby set up .
the united kingdom authorities have offered to implement the measure with the rules defined in recitals ( 187 ) to ( 190 ) .
in a third step , bnfl purchased magnox electric from the government for a symbolic price of one pound .
the proposal can therefore be considered to be one of the measures necessary for the global improvement of the quality of the air which we , ourselves , breathe , and we cannot fail to give this measure our full support .
it is present in nearly all steps of the nuclear fuel cycle : it enriches uranium ( through urenco ) , supplies nuclear fuel , generates electricity and manages spent nuclear fuel .
i do not feel it would be appropriate to lay down further requirements , and that is why i call upon the house to vote against amendment no 20 .
over the last ten years the united states government has introduced performance-based contracts for nuclear clean-up .
just this evening , the commission explained that the goal of the directive is to protect the environment , and to do so without prejudicing or affecting existing measures taken at community or national level to protect the health of workers , as , moreover , is stated in recital 14 .
the next item is the report ( a5-0292 / 2003 ) by mr lisi , on behalf of the committee on the environment , public health and consumer policy , on the proposal for a european parliament and council directive on the limitation of emissions of volatile organic compounds due to the use of organic solvents in decorative paints and varnishes and vehicle refinishing products and amending directive 1999 / 13 / ec &#91; com ( 2002 ) 750 - c5-0632 / 2002 - 2002 / 0301 ( cod ) &#93; .
limiting the solvent content in these products is considered to be the only practicable way to help reduce voc emissions and , consequently , air pollution from this major source .
the cs-vis will be developed to store the order of transmitted segmented and sequenced fingerprint images .
however , the unrestricted introduction and operation of electricity generation from renewable energy sources would create difficulties with regard to the stability of the system and security of supply .
with this in view , the staff of the eu institutions need to be educated about the regulation and convinced of the advantages of openness .
it is therefore necessary to set up a group of experts in the field of multilingualism and to define its tasks and its structure .
the commission should have one register , not several .
all documents must be registered , something that does not happen at present .
the consignment complies with the guarantees , including those for packaging and labelling and the appropriate specific additional requirements , as laid down in the animal health certificate , drawn up in conformity with the model in annex iv , taking into account the explanatory notes in annex iii ; and
mr president , notwithstanding the commissioner &apos;s comments earlier today about her eyesight , i have decided to move forward in this rather vast auditorium so that i can at least see her for this evening &apos;s debate .
as regards switzerland , decision 2004 / 512 / ec constitutes a development of the provisions of the schengen acquis within the meaning of the agreement signed by the european union , the european community and the swiss confederation on the latter &apos;s association with the implementation , application and development of the schengen acquis which fall within the area referred to in article 4 ( 1 ) of the council decision on the signing , on behalf of the european community , and on the provisional application of certain provisions of this agreement .
i have been criticised by allegedly greener members for doing this and for not being sufficiently ambitious by supporting the target limits proposed in the annex .
a white paper entitled managing the nuclear legacy - a strategy for action was published in july 2002 .
the european commission is right to propose a revision of the existing directive , which aims to restrict this air pollution .
the italian government has submitted a list containing two candidates to complete the list of 22 candidates already submitted and arrive at a number of candidates equal to the number of seats allocated to it by the treaties .
edf supports the commission &apos;s actions to set up a community-wide framework for solving such problems , and welcomes the fact that the commission takes account of the euratom treaty in the matter .
harmonisation must not be at the expense of social achievements , however .
let me put it very clearly : if the internal market means that the trade unions are deprived of the right and the opportunity to champion better working conditions , then my group will say &apos; no &apos; .

in order for a subsequent period of exceptional market circumstances to commence either test a or test b must again be satisfied .
for this reason , our group advocates lowering the limit values in line with the study carried out by the commission .
experience in a number of countries has shown that europe can still have beautiful , good-quality colours even with fewer solvents .
i also expressly support the extension of the directive , agreed to by a significant majority of the committee on the environment , public health and consumer policy , to include dangerous substances in addition to volatile organic compounds present in paints , varnishes and vehicle refinishing products .

that is a threat to the entire paint industry , and first and foremost to small- and medium-sized enterprises , as well as a severe setback for our european economic area .
it is technically impossible to reduce the proportion of volatile organic solvents to below 300 grams per litre by 2007 and still further by 2010 , but it is technically possible and sensible to reduce the proportion of these substances to 400 grams per litre by 2007 and to a permissible maximum value of 300 grams per litre by 2010 .
it will also comment on whether the nuclear decommissioning authority achieved its goal to recover the share of the nuclear liabilities of the power plants that are attributable to the nuclear decommissioning authority , and the reasons why it could not if it did not .
following a substantiated request submitted by germany , it is appropriate to amend the demarcation of the restricted zone in germany .
this practice was confirmed by article 4 ( 1 ) of commission regulation ( ec ) no 794 / 2004 implementing council regulation ( ec ) no 659 / 1999 laying down detailed rules for the application of article 93 of the ec treaty .
the current commission proposal does not provide for that possibility , and should therefore be amended on that point .
surely it cannot be the aim of the commission to offer less protection to workers than is currently the case .
after all , we are talking here about substances that pose a risk not only to the environment , but also to public health .
later increments in these costs are marginal as compared with those created at the outset .
eur 15155000 for germany ;
, and in particular article 24 ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) and article 32 thereof ,

it is an extremely sound proposal which will entail a considerable improvement where such emissions are concerned .
there is still time to correct that mistake now .
in a number of amendments , i propose at least following the standards in the decopaint study .
that study was carried out at the request of the european commission , but , sadly , was not then incorporated into the proposals .
tightening up the regulations in this way is opposed by the countries that have not yet taken these health-protection measures , and in particular by the industry producing chemical raw materials and the paint industry .
what is to stop us from making protection in all the countries of the eu just as good as in the member state with the most far-reaching measures , so that those who work with paint may stay healthy everywhere ?
if no new victims emerge there now , it will be thanks to the low limit values that set the standard at a maximum of 100 grams of solvent per litre of paint for a large number of products , and to the compulsory replacement with alternative products .
as regards magnox power plants , the united kingdom believes that the measure will not have any impact on the electricity market .

this restriction will not be applied to contracts entered into before the date of the commission decision or to contracts where formal offers approved by the nuclear decommissioning authority and the united kingdom &apos;s department for trade and industry have been issued to customers and are under negotiation before that date or to contracts entered into after that date pursuant to a letter of intent entered into before that date .
quite apart from the question of principle concerning the commission &apos;s right of initiative , we firmly believe that it would be unwise to guess at what we should do in four or five years in order to improve air quality .
further additional information was submitted by the united kingdom by letter of 7 february 2006 , registered by the commission on 10 february 2006 .
amendment no 12 proposes enlarging the scope of the directive by including vocs with a boiling point - as several members have mentioned - up to 280 ° c rather than the 250 ° c proposed by the commission .
firstly , because organic compounds with a boiling point above 250 ° c have a very low volatility : it takes several days for them to dry out and they have a very limited ozone formation potential .
such a standard has to be developed in order to allow for this deduction .
other customer contributions not included above
in total , the commission can , to a greater or lesser degree , accept 20 of the 83 amendments tabled for the vote in plenary tomorrow .
the commission considers that the development of this market is an excellent opportunity for the community economy as a whole .
in duly substantiated cases , exemptions may be made to the rule governing publication of the names of members .
however , and for exactly the same reason , the commission cannot agree to include a number of amendments which directly or indirectly aim to enhance the protection of workers &apos; and consumers &apos; health from exposure to solvents in the paints and other products covered by the proposals - amendments nos 17 , 20 and 23 .
this makes sense from an environmental point of view , as it is the part of the vocs that evaporates into the atmosphere we want to reduce .
the aid from the united kingdom government would be limited to what is required in recognition of the government &apos;s ultimate responsibility for nuclear safety and security in the country .
mr president , firstly , i should have started by thanking mr lisi for his work as rapporteur on this important proposal .
let us stay inside the equal label criteria we already have .
bnfl has spent gbp 5,1 billion for meeting these liabilities .
it is going to make sure that we reduce the incidence of asthma caused by ground-level ozone .
it has brought forward a proposal which is very good , not quite perfect - but nothing ever is - and is taking a proposal from this parliament seriously and acting on it .
this approach has also been upheld by the court in its judgment of 20 november 2003 in case c-126 / 01 .
information obtained by participating in the deliberations of a group or sub-group may not be divulged if , in the opinion of the commission , that information relates to confidential matters .
still on the subject of energy , the eu also launched in johannesburg the renewable energy coalition .
this money is already reserved in the budget , but the council has so far been reluctant to free up the resources .
the commission has tabled an ambitious proposal to allocate eur 1 billion from the european development fund to set up an eu water fund .
in the short term we need to expand unep &apos;s role in the world summit implementation .
commission decision 2005 / 393 / ec of 23 may 2005 on protection and surveillance zones in relation to bluetongue and conditions applying to movements from or through these zones &#91; 2 &#93; provides for the demarcation of the global geographic areas where protection and surveillance zones ( &quot; the restricted zones &quot; ) are to be established by the member states in relation to bluetongue .
with a view to developing a new strategy for multilingualism , in accordance with the communication from the commission entitled &quot; a new framework strategy for multilingualism &quot; &#91; 1 &#93; , the commission may need to call upon the expertise of specialists in an advisory body .
i also told you that our slogan for the summit would continue to guide us in the implementation phase : from words to deeds .
let me turn to some of the broader issues associated with the world summit implementation and reflected in the draft resolution .
unep was also asked to take an active role in the pursuit of the ten-year framework of programmes on sustainable consumption and production , agreed in johannesburg .
on this basis , the euratom treaty establishes the european atomic energy community , creating the necessary instruments and attributing responsibilities to achieve these objectives .

the british nuclear sector was then restructured in several steps .
could you clarify this for me once more ?
the commission considers that this process makes it possible to conclude that slc funding involves no state aid .
the debate is closed .
the nda will therefore have no incentive to use aid to provide services below the market price , and certainly no interest in using the aid to decrease its costs .
one year after our return from johannesburg we must keep up the momentum and maintain political leadership in the european union by delivering on our johannesburg commitments .
i want to address the specific points in mrs jackson &apos;s oral question before taking the opportunity to add a few more general points on the johannesburg follow-up .
in our stocktaking paper on the world summit follow-up the commission plans to submit to parliament and to the council a detailed report on both initiatives .
this is stipulated in article 17 of regulation ( ec ) no 1 / 2004 , see footnote 20 .
third , the commission services are now preparing a stocktaking document on the summit follow-up that will be submitted by the end of 2003 and that may also include proposals for further action .
let me now turn to the first part of the oral question , reporting specifically on the water and energy initiatives .
magnox power plants
the commission took the view that such an approach could indeed be undertaken in principle , but also expressed doubts that the united kingdom authorities had submitted sufficient proof that the positive impact of the aid on fulfilling the objectives of the euratom treaty outweighed its negative impact on competition in the internal market .
where our own policy is concerned , we need to adjust the economic regulations so that we provide sufficient positive incentives for the far more efficient management of energy and materials .
one way of doing this would , in actual fact , be to ensure that the european development fund , or edf , was incorporated into the ordinary budget , something which we in parliament have always demanded .
in the case of springfields , the allocation distinguished between liabilities linked to the reprocessing of magnox spent fuel , liabilities linked to the reprocessing of agr spent fuel and other liabilities .
what is really required - and what is not at all happening - is for priority to be given to the supply of energy and to sensible efforts in this area , not only on the part of the commission but also on that of the recipient countries .
the springfields site , which is dedicated to nuclear fuel manufacturing ;
when it comes to the energy issue , i am unfortunately rather pessimistic .
in this area , we at present lack any reporting worthy of the name .
finally , i wish , just like mrs wallström , naturally to focus upon the issues related to poverty .
ornamental fish imported under this decision shall not be released into fish farms , or other premises from which they could escape into , or otherwise contaminate , natural waters in the community .
&quot; other &quot; : intended for purposes not listed elsewhere in this classification , such as private import or trough transhippers .
i am confident that i can count on parliament &apos;s continued support in pursuing these efforts .
mr president , firstly , i too wish to say thank you to mrs wallström .
aeroplane ship railway wagon
i am well aware of her commitment to these issues , and the information she provided about what has happened following the johannesburg summit was welcome .
i also wish to thank mr de roo for his draft of a sound resolution , which we shall vote on tomorrow .
we all - or many of us at least - had high expectations prior to johannesburg , but the outcome fell far short of these .
the management of nuclear liabilities was generally not taken into consideration , or only in a very limited way .
to a certain extent , i believe that the difficulties have to do with the fact that the work on sustainable development in a way runs counter to our traditional method of working .
in the light of the above , the commission considers that the aid provided for in article 35 of rl no 5 / 2000 in favour of undertakings involved in the processing and marketing of agricultural products is in accordance with point 4.2 of the community guidelines for state aid in the agriculture sector .
on the contrary , most of us have a segmented education .
in the extreme case where the power plant is so inefficient that it covers no more than its operating costs , the first owner would be liable for all decommissioning costs and the new one for none .
these laboratories should have proven experience of using the required detection method and have a quality assurance system complying with iso standard 17025 and be submitted to the supervision of the nrl .
it is very important to ensure a balance between social , economic and environmental elements .
i see sustainable development as an embodiment of the task that god has set mankind to dress and keep the earth .
mr president , when we discussed the results of the johannesburg summit in this house last year , i concluded my contribution by criticising the optimism about the results of the un world summit on sustainable development , asking myself whether my grandchildren would be so optimistic in 20 years &apos; time .
the path is long , but soft power will triumph .
we have not reached that point yet at world level .
for the period from 1 july 2006 to 31 december 2006 , that financial contribution shall not exceed 128000 eur .
definitive financial allocations for the 2005 / 2006 marketing year ( 2006 financial year )
the maximum financial contribution from the community shall be eur 20 per test for bacteriological detection of salmonella spp. and eur 30 for serotyping of the relevant isolates .
the targets for drinking water and sanitation , chemicals , fish stocks and the reduction of poverty , starvation and child mortality should be followed by tangible action and policy .
furthermore , when reaching political agreement on regulation ( ec ) no 1698 / 2005 , the council and the commission agreed in a joint declaration regarding bulgaria and romania to extend the measure on advisory services provided for in annex viii to the act of accession of bulgaria and romania until 2013 as regards the provision of advisory services to farmers receiving semi-subsistence support .
has this refusal to release funds been universal ; has it been entirely by agreement of the council or has it been the case that some member states have been instrumental in securing the blocking of expenditure ?
has any expenditure at all been authorised by the council or has everything been blocked ?
annex viii to the act of accession should be adapted to take this agreement into account .
the commissioner has already mentioned a number of the points i wanted to raise .
she has informed us about the water and energy initiatives .
date of shipment to the laboratory .
mr president , it has been one year since johannesburg and eleven years since rio de janeiro .
the requirement of ex ante approval by the commission of project selection and contracting for measures no 1 &quot; investments into agricultural holdings &quot; and no 2 &quot; improving the processing and marketing of agricultural and fishery products &quot; by croatia for in article 12 ( 1 ) of regulation ( ec ) no 1266 / 1999 is hereby waived .
mr president , i recognise what the commission is doing to prepare for the implementation of our programme to improve sanitation .
i should like to thank members for their contributions .
it must be noted that transitional arrangements were put in place by the united kingdom to ensure that , even though bnfl &apos;s assets were formally transferred to the nda , no state aid is granted until the commission takes a final decision on the case .
the next opportunity for us is to return to it when we provide the report and keep it constantly on our common agenda .
there are a number of initiatives that range from looking at the approach to river-basin management , to big rivers in africa , to very concrete projects like drilling wells .
2005 estimates of assets and liabilities to be transferred from bnfl to the nda showing bnfl contribution towards its nuclear liabilities .
the commission considers that these estimates show that about 12 % of the pollution costs will not be covered by the polluters , which demonstrates that the measure does not fully implement the polluter-pays principle .
however , when we discuss the &apos; water for life &apos; initiative , it covers both water and sanitation .
the council is not fond of the idea of setting up a secretariat for the particular purpose of a water fund - although perhaps you should ask the council about this , because who am i to say how it discusses the matter ?
our other problem is that we know each other , perhaps , too well in our discussions on sustainable development .
based on its own experience , be also believes that the measure will not artificially prolong the lifetime of bnfl &apos;s plants , since , still according to be &apos;s estimates , these power plants should reasonably be in a position to cover their srmcs .
i support the draft european constitution because , for all its faults , it is a useful instrument for enhancing effectiveness and democracy in the eu .
i hereby declare that i abstained from voting on the mccarthy report .
that has been a problem within the council .
the united kingdom is confident that the commission will take the terms of its decision on the restructuring plan of be fully into account when considering the facts of the present case .
whereas rio was still an environmental conference , johannesburg was concerned with everything : water , aids , schooling , energy , poverty , malaria and environment .

the signalling data and rules required to be handled by the ertms / etcs system .
this applies to the europeans , it applies to the americans , it applies to the palestinians , it applies to the israelis , and it applies to the chechens and to everyone in the world .
see section 4.2.9 ( etcs-id management ) ,
these requirements are specified in annex a index 59 .
it is essential that such an analysis develops against a framework of coherent implementation rules and guidelines .
interface between etcs and stm
i believe you really are doing what you have described , and that you are working day and night and talking to the key actors .
let me say , not only on my own behalf , but also on behalf of my parliamentary group , that if a wall is constructed which leads to more hatred and more humiliation , this is a further argument , to my mind , for having an international peacekeeping force to keep the two hostile parties apart .
for the control-command equipment that is not defined as class a only the verification requirements associated with interoperability ( for example emc ) are included in this tsi .
define the safe operating parameters and conditions of use of the class b system ( including , but not limited to , maintenance and degraded modes ) .
i am profoundly convinced , ladies and gentlemen , that the construction of this wall is a very great tragedy .
it is a tragedy for israel too , because it will simply lead to more hatred and revulsion .
if you would permit me to make a personal remark , i can trace my political commitment back to when , at the start of 1962 , i saw a wall in my own country .
there is some doubt as to whether education for peace really does exist amongst the palestinian and israeli people , or whether what actually exists is education for hatred .
particular migration paths
there is nothing to be gained from the latter. i believe this matter deserves attention .
for the control-command equipment that is not defined as class a only the verification requirements associated with interoperability ( for example stm / ertms etcs on-board interface ) are included in this tsi .
radio communications with the train .
compatibility of the rolling stock with control-command track-side assembly ( e.g. emc aspects , operation of track circuits and axle counters ) .
the in-fill data transmission function in etcs level 1 applications is only mandatory on-board under the conditions defined in chapter 7 .
i wish you well , gentlemen. you can count on our support .
migration paths
section 5.2 of module sh2 ( full quality management system with design examination ) , validation under full operational conditions is defined in section 0 ( on-board assembly validation ) and section 0 ( track-side assembly validation ) .
guaranteed train braking performance and characteristics
perhaps the gradual approach that has been chosen , whereby the toughest issues are left until last , should be rethought .
it is important not to play into the hands of the terrorists .
peace will have another chance , if prime minister ala &apos;s government gets to work and discharges its responsibilities regarding security , and if the israeli government is able to demonstrate restraint and generosity so as to reduce tension .
indeed it is its duty to do so. nonetheless , if terrorism is to be dealt with effectively , it must be dealt with within the framework of international law .
that is the bottom line .
these requirements are specified in annex a , index 16 .
metal-free space around wheels
europe will offer mr ala and his government strong and active support for such efforts .
the content of the ec declaration of verification shall conform to annex v to directive 2001 / 16 / ec .
we all thought that after the iraq war , more intensive efforts would be made to find a solution to this apparently unending middle east conflict .
this interface to rolling stock tsi &apos;s is only relevant to the basic parameter described in section 4.2.6.3 ( odometry ) when odometry equipment is supplied as a separate interoperability constituent ( see section 5.2.2 grouping of interoperability constituents ) .
having institutions that work well is the basis for long-term stability and security for both palestine and israel .
verify which optional functions are implemented ,
isolation of the on-board etcs functionality .
israel now has to adopt a sufficient number of measures to strengthen trust .
hamas and others do not recognise israel &apos;s right to exist , as shown by the terrible suicide attacks and other terrorist acts .
in addition , there seems to be a growing lack of any ability , power or willingness to set up efficient institutions , especially in the security field .
the aim of such an approach is to ensure such ertms readiness by piggybacking such pre-fitment activities on major construction or upgrading operations of infrastructure assets or on factory-fit of rolling-stock assets .
safety information recorder
this rejection of the two-state solution and the failure to implement the roadmap seem to be based on ideological reasons or on security fears .
this applies notably to the procurement of new rolling-stock or major retrofitting operations for which the value of the signalling equipment and of its installation represent only a limited percentage of the whole investment to be put in place .
basic interoperability constituents
section 5.2 of module sd ( production quality management system ) ,
we are all alarmed too at the danger of the conflict spreading to neighbouring countries. further , i believe we all agree that we would like to see in place a prime minister of the palestinian authority who would be willing and able to act against terrorist organisations and put an end to them .

ensure that the application of the class b system meets national safety targets ,
who , too , will dare to give a real warning to the other countries that are stirring up conflict between palestine and israel , headed by syria and iran ?
they forget , for instance , that the palestinian constitution denies the existence of israel ; they forget that palestinian school books teach that israel does not exist and that its people do not exist and never have existed ; they forget that , in 1999 or 2000 , the camp david initiative failed because of yasser arafat &apos;s clumsiness at negotiating and accepting a compromise that might , perhaps , have resulted in a very different situation from the one we have today ; they also forget everything about which we are quite rightly indignant , because we demand a lot from israel , a democratic people , and we are also entitled to demand a lot from peoples that are not democratic but , we hope , will become so .
i should like to thank mr poettering for his very clear remarks about that wall .
operational radio functions
the interface between the odometry function and ertms / etcs on-board shall meet the requirements of annex a , index 44 .
this is indeed an abomination in economic and human terms , but it is also a real provocation in political terms .
we no doubt all share the high representative &apos;s frustrations , but we must keep to the quartet &apos;s road map for peace in the middle east .
it may also be necessary to send an international intervention and observation force to the region , a force that the quartet must assemble , that , under the auspices of the un , would monitor developments and that , subsequently , could guarantee that the final peace agreement was being observed by the parties .
we call on the quartet and on the parties concerned to declare the city of jerusalem a cultural and religious heritage of mankind. we also call for jerusalem to become a dual capital , at once the capital of the state of israel and of the future palestinian state .
the title of the report i have been privileged to draft refers to peace and dignity in the middle east. i chose these two words deliberately , because i think they provide a clear indication of how things stand and what we need to aim at .
on the one hand , we invite the palestinian side to reorganise its security forces and make tangible visible efforts to dismantle terrorist organisations. on the other , we call on the israeli side to withdraw its army from the autonomous territories .
mr president , i too should like to thank the high representative for his statement .
of course , it is a good thing to go there , and i , too , thank mr solana and i thank mr moratinos very much , although i have to say that , at the time of the quartet , marc otte was , in fact , absent because of ariel sharon &apos;s blackmail at the most sensitive moment when they were resuming talks on the roadmap .
we were not there at that moment , because we rightly recognised that ariel sharon had been legitimately elected .
every time , however - it is not just a trivial thing to say : it really is true , and that is how it is - every time , some leaders get killed .
yasser arafat has been a prisoner for the last three years and he certainly cannot be in military control of the jenin area , where there are israeli tanks , bulldozers and soldiers .
member states shall establish a national implementation plan of the tsi in accordance with the criteria specified in chapter 7 of the annex .
see annex a , index 42 .
i believe parliament must support the quartet and the european union as they contribute to the middle east peace process .
lines specially designed or upgraded for freight services ,
i feel responsible , together with you , all of you , for what is happening in that country , because it is not enough just to call for compliance with international law .
international law should be obeyed , but not a single resolution is being obeyed .
the fitting of ertms / etcs is mandatory in the case of :
this consistency must be checked in particular with regard to the specifications of the subsystem , its interfaces vis-à-vis the system in which it is integrated , as well as the operating and maintenance rules .
at the request of the contracting entity or its representative established in the community the notified body carries out ec verification of an on-board or track-side assembly in accordance with annex vi to directive 2001 / 16 / ec .
- mr president , who will take the risk of defying , let alone attempting to dismantle , the palestinian terrorist organisations hamas and islamic jihad ?
how , mr solana , do you respond to that , or is the council remaining silent about its explicit demand that the palestinian authority should dismantle terrorist organisations within the areas under its control ?
also international corridors and international use of rolling stock should be considered .
data communication only for level 1 with radio in-fill or level 2 / 3
the integration verification tests shall be performed to demonstrate that the components of the assembly have been correctly interconnected and interfaced to the train to ensure that the required functionality and performance required for that application of the assembly is achieved .
that was the idea at oslo and the idea that has been nurtured up to now .
i do not believe , however , that this gradual approach is working any more .
we should roundly condemn the fact that israeli defence force attacks since 2001 have effectively destroyed eur 25 million of eu development projects .

approximately a week ago , 19 people died in a suicide attack in haifa .
( electromagnetic compatibility ) ,
in this way , the palestinian prime minister has provided absolutely the best grounds for pessimism to all those who do not think there is a future for the middle east and all those who do not believe there can be peace there .
with military decoupling from israel increasing greatly , it is difficult to imagine syria taking the risk of military escalation in the golan heights .
what we are seeing at the moment , however , is the modest and slow nature of the initial reaction from damascus , which has undeniably brought the global weakness of syria &apos;s current position to the fore .
establishes the functional and technical specifications to be met by the subsystem and its interfaces vis-à-vis other subsystems .
it is undeniable that between president assad , who is sticking to a rigid political stance and whose duty it is , therefore , to react strongly to the serious provocation represented by an attack on syrian soil , and prime minister sharon who , 13 months away from the us elections , can feel that he has a particularly free rein , there are elements that could further inflame tensions and result in the entire region becoming engulfed .
ladies and gentlemen , the middle east crisis is escalating .
the adoption of such a policy will push in the longer-term for the scenario of etcs on-board equipment as a commodity asset in what regards new rolling-stock .
the type-examination procedure ( module b ) for the design and development phase in combination with the product verification procedure ( module f ) , or

appendix 1 tsi control-command
the palestinian prime minister &apos;s , ahmad quray &apos;s , impotence in the face of terrorism is perhaps in itself entirely understandable .
providing the automatic train protection function and cab-signalling .
in a democratic country such as israel , which is a sign to the rest of the world that democracy exists in the middle east , every such suicide attack carried out by a terrorist group will make israeli opinion less willing to compromise with the palestinian authority and less well disposed towards handing land over to the palestinians .
there are probably arguments in favour of both sides .
the climatic and physical environmental conditions expected in the infrastructure shall be indicated in the infrastructure register , by reference to annex a , index a5 .
the european union can also demand that this illegal wall be destroyed , in accordance with the famous roadmap .
the lines mentioned above presently not equipped with class a shall be equipped either :
in this case , the respective railway would double equip existing lines with the etcs system .
as we have reiterated on many occasions , there is no such thing as good terrorism , just as there is no such thing as bad terrorism .
we cannot tolerate any argument for resorting to it , otherwise we recognise its ends as legitimate .
the professional qualifications required for the operation of the control-command subsystem are covered by the tsi traffic operation and management .
in practical terms , there should to be a mixture of both ways .
in addition to the requirements specified in the maintenance plans , see section 4.5 ( maintenance rules ) , precautions shall be taken to ensure health and safety for maintenance and operations staff , in accordance with the european regulations and the national regulations that are compatible with the european legislation .
that is because we are fully convinced that the resolution of the conflict in the middle east would deprive international terrorism of a powerful ideological prop .
- mr president , horrifying though they may be , the terrorist attacks in the middle east - whether palestinian suicide bombings against jews or targeted israeli strikes against palestinians - cannot hide the fundamentals of the problem .
commanding a financial support from structural funds ( regulation ( ec ) no 1260 / 1999 ) and / or cohesion funds ( regulation ( ec ) no 1264 / 1999 ) in excess of 30 % of the total project costs .
that is because , as long as we , here in the eu , do not force israel to comply with these conditions , abu allah does not have an earthly chance of stopping the palestinian suicide bombers .
equally , israel must meet her obligations by freezing settlement activity , restoring palestinian freedom of movement , ending targeted assassinations and ensuring that the security fence does not encroach on palestinian land .
in view for such a backbone to contribute to a major re-engineering of international rail transport services in a credible time horizon from the perspective of the customer it is necessary to attach a relatively ambitious timeframe for its full realisation .
a train equipped with a class a on-board system for a given level of application shall be able to operate on that level and any lower one .
indeed , is the european community powerful enough to make an effective contribution here ?
i have visited all the countries in the region , and it has become clear to me that the issue of iraq has a bearing on the palestinian problem .
i believe it is also fair to say there is a significant degree of consensus across the house that recent events may lead to an escalation of tension in the region. this could be the case in either syria or lebanon .
driver &apos;s external field of view
this so-called incremental process began with the oslo process , and the road map is a further stage of it .
it is therefore important to ensure that any verification mechanisms are such that they can be implemented immediately. this was also discussed at the new york meeting .

what is at stake , then , is market domination by the investment capital of one country or another , while the degree of liberalisation of such capital and its various operators increases , raising enormous amounts of capital through pension funds and the privatisation of social security .
at the same time , elementary prudential rules and the transparency of operations are also at stake because of their cost .
it is in parliament &apos;s interest to have valid initiatives with at least the resources they need to achieve their objectives .
i.e. the fifth carcase to be processed on the 19th day of that month should be sampled for the survey .
hence , it is important that the member states should find ways of making basic information available free of charge , ensuring that it is accessible to all , especially via the internet and other accessible means , and paying particular attention to people with disabilities .
it was also a positive step to recognise the right of any citizen , any natural or legal person residing in a member state , to have access to european parliament , council and commission documents .
this gives me grounds for optimism about the willingness to debate and discuss this issue within the acp partnership , because as you know it is one that we unfortunately have to deal with in these countries .
no . ( s ) of cites
personal attributes ,
they must not be allowed to get into a situation where they have as it were to live from hand to mouth and worry every year whether their work , which is tremendously important for the victims , will be able to be continued .
i should like to stress here that it is not only about offering victims somewhere to stay , a shelter , but also quite specifically about giving them access to legal assistance and psychological treatment .
in order to cover the shortage , spain should be authorised , for a limited period of time , to approve for marketing seed and planting stock produced from seed of the species pinus radiata which satisfies less stringent requirements with respect to identification and labelling .
in africa , there is hardly any country where torture is not practised .
the homogenised lymph nodes shall be weighed and placed in a sterile container with pre-warmed buffered peptone water ( bpw ) in dilution 1 : 10 .
in latin america , torture has thankfully declined considerably since the 1970s and 1980s .
just a few years ago there were particularly cruel cases of torture in kosovo .
the derogation has no negative impact on the community &apos;s own resources accruing from vat ,
in asia , it is often precisely important european union trading partners - who otherwise appear in pinstripes as business associates - who have perfected various forms of torture and unfortunately the issue is still relevant here in europe .
in chechnya , for example , the russian military is responsible for committing brutal acts of torture , and no one is talking about it .
or look to the east , for example : thankfully the situation in central europe has improved - next to me is sitting my friend figel from slovakia , a human rights campaigner - and happily 12 years ago these nations overthrew the cruel regimes that practised torture in a democratic revolution , but in the member states of the council of europe , which is meeting concurrently at the other side of the ill , the problem still exists .
tomorrow in the council of europe , they will discuss whether to introduce monitoring for liechtenstein .
&quot; preventive action &quot;
this is not just about far-away third countries or past periods of history ; it is about the reality of our foreign policy .
a final report shall be forwarded by 31 october 2007 at the latest on the technical execution of the survey , together with supporting evidence for the costs incurred and the results attained during the period 1 october 2006 to 30 september 2007 ; the evidence as to costs incurred shall comprise at least the information set out in annex ii ;
the catchment area of river cernon from the source to the barrier at saint george de luzençon ,
reporting from member states
following recommendations on a contribution from the swiss confederation by the eu operation commander and the european union military committee ( eumc ) , the contribution from the swiss confederation should be accepted .
samples arriving later than within 72 hours after sampling shall be discarded unless analysis is initiated within 96 hours after sampling and the cold chain was not interrupted .
it was , however , precisely the twentieth century that in a very particular way produced cruel forms of torture and the cruel torturous regimes of communism and national socialism , and we have to recognise that , even at the beginning of the twenty-first century , torture regrettably continues to be a reality in many parts of the world .
article 8 ( 1 ) ( c ) of regulation ( eec ) no 729 / 70 provides for the member states to take the measures necessary to recover sums lost as a result of irregularities or negligence .
obviously we reject both forms of torture in equal measure .
mr president , commissioner , so much is clear .
in addition to the financial contribution from the community , a further contribution should be granted for the organisation of workshops in areas falling under the responsibility of the community reference laboratories .
many believe that military expenditure should be increased ; while we , on the contrary , are inclined to think that it should be reduced .
&quot; auditor &quot;
model animal health certificate for the imports of tropical ornamental fish into the european community
mr president , i should like to say first of all that i share the hope that the code of conduct , when applied in the long term , will mean that fewer arms are manufactured , whereas mr von wogau gave the impression in his speech that the aim was for less money to be spent on manufacturing arms .
all continental and coastal areas within denmark .
the report being debated , however good the rapporteur &apos;s intentions may be , does not refer to these questions , or rather it conceals them .
the emphasis should be on assessing whether planned arrangements are capable of delivering sufficient guarantees on ( a ) the safety of the end-product ( s ) and ( b ) compliance with other feed and food law requirements and with animal health and welfare rules .
it is also necessary to have a register of how the arms are intended to be used when they reach the end-user , and for this purpose we need a joint surveillance office in the european union .
we would be pleased if the french initiative were successful .
indeed , the production of and trade in arms secures huge excess profits for multinational big business which , with privatisation , now controls these sectors .
there is therefore a need to adapt the act of accession of bulgaria and romania so that it is compatible with regulation ( ec ) no 1698 / 2005 .
however , they satisfy the speculative appetites of the political-military-industrial network which , especially after september 11 , now has absolute control over us policy and is also strengthening its influence in the countries of the european union .
these developments , of course , are fraught with huge dangers for the peoples of the european union and for mankind as a whole within the framework of intra-imperialist rivalry .
we hear of some cases of completely irresponsible behaviour : of arms being exported to crisis regions causing conflicts to escalate , instead of arms exports being reduced or stopped , which would help to take the heat out of these conflicts .
in the convention and the draft constitution we have said that europe needs to shoulder more responsibility in the world .
moreover , the adaptations to the act of accession should be limited to what is absolutely necessary .
1 mm , shall be fully filled with a jointing material as specified in en 13963 ( the other joints may remain unfilled ) .
where a body or a committee has been established with a view to independent scrutiny of the audit process , one or more independent persons should be members of such body or committee. such independent persons should have access to the audit process and be empowered to contribute fully to it .
it is important to take account of the enlargement of the union in this connection too , as the considerable market in conventional weapons still focuses on the countries included in the accession now and those countries bordering on them .
follow-up of audit results
it is unclear , however , how they are passed from one to the other .
the aim too is to prevent the illegal manufacture of , and trade in , arms .
the legislation in force in finland on the export of armaments is in accordance with the recommendations laid down in the un firearms protocol and in the osce document on small arms and light weapons .

could you perhaps also confirm that mr stevenson is in fact free to stand up for scotland if he wishes to .
mr posselt , whom i thank for his opinion , regretted that fewer and fewer young people are taking up this wonderful rural occupation of beekeeping .
an advance of 50 % of the total amount referred to in annex ii may be paid at the request of the member state concerned .
such sampling should therefore be used as a tool to monitor the prevalence of salmonella in slaughter pigs .
the swiss confederation shall be represented in the committee of contributors set up by decision monuc spt / 2 / 2006 .
i am happy to follow that up positively , mrs zorba. thank you for raising the matter .
opportunity to comment on draft audit report
i just wanted to register extreme surprise that we were not able to discuss the matter in this plenary session. as a result we are not serving the citizens of the union .
regulation as last amended by regulation ( ec ) no 1003 / 2005 ( oj l 170 , 1.7.2005 , p . 12 ) .
method 2 - mechanically fixed to a solid wood-based substrate
i would also call for something that is always the subject of some ridicule , but which is ecologically important , namely the pollination premium for colonies of bees , so that we promote this activity by giving beekeepers more support .
unfortunately , the war against terror has turned into a war against freedom , against the freedom to travel in safety , to walk in the street , to meet people and to lead a daily life without fear and terror .
nonetheless , commissioner , our fight to combat violence and protect victims must not stop .
its findings are that the deterioration in the health of bees and the reduced performance of colonies observed in a number of countries probably do not have such a simple , single cause .
i actually believe that we in europe should finally see this issue , which is regarded by some perhaps as a bit of a joke , for what it is , namely a health issue and a prerequisite for a functioning environment and ecological system .
frankly , if some of you have the impression that no serious scientific work has been done on plant protection products and their consequences for bees , then i believe you are mistaken .
the aggregate of ileocaecal lymph nodes or at least five individual ileocaecal lymph nodes of all selected pigs .
the spanish government has pardoned them , so they can torture with impunity in spain .
follow-up of audit outcome
in the end , however , it was not that .
political and legal actions must be taken soon , because finding solutions to torture is a matter of urgency .
zona valle del fiume serchio : the water catchment area of the river serchio from its sources to the piaggione dam ,
article 17 ( 2 ) of that regulation lays down that member states are to make the statement referred to in article 16 ( 1 ) ( b ) only if the amount which they have declared in accordance with article 16 ( 1 ) ( a ) , i.e. the expenditure actually incurred as of 30 june of the current financial year , is at least equal to 75 % of the indicative amount allocated to the member state concerned .
naturally , our contemporary experience has taught that any confession can be extracted under torture .
the cases listed in annex ii are hereby cleared and the corresponding amounts charged to the community budget .
means the description of the activities and arrangements for an audit .
samples shall be sent within 36 hours by fast mail or courier and shall reach the laboratory no later than 72 hours after sampling .
we ought not to pretend that we are doing something serious to oppose torture so long as we do not set up a more ambitious compromise , particularly denouncing by name those responsible for torture .

members of the quartet formally undertook to meet again before the end of this year. an announcement to that effect was made at the end of the meeting .
the financial contribution provided for in article 4 shall be granted to the member states provided that the survey is implemented in accordance with the relevant provisions of community law , including the rules on competition and on the award of public contracts , and subject to compliance with the following conditions :
as a result of pressure from europe , it was also agreed that the special representatives should meet regularly. these individuals are resident in the area .

the contracting entity may lodge an application for the assessment of the assembly at this step from a notified body .
can you explain to me the added value of action relating to the return of immigrants ? can you explain to me what contribution will be made by a european fund which cannot be created at the moment by the member states , who have full competence in the field of return ?
if necessary , these specifications may vary according to the use of the subsystem , for example according to the categories of line , hub and / or rolling stock provided for in annex i to the directive - chapter 4 ( characterisation of the subsystem ) ;
independently of the selected module , the provisions of annex a index 47 , index a1 , and where relevant index a2 and index a3 shall be applied .
register of infrastructure
taking into account the range of parameters that impact on the latter ( e.g. level of investment resources , engineering / project management capability of the railways and supply industry , needs for cross-border co-ordination of activities ) a period of 10 to 12 years can be earmarked as an indicative timeframe for such a purpose .
the implementation of gsm-r systems on a nation-wide basis has already started in a significant number of countries of the former eu15 .
to facilitate the universal use of the equipment for the control-command on-board assembly on new rolling stock accepted for operation upon the trans-european conventional network , the electromagnetic conditions expected on the train shall be defined in accordance with annex a , index a6 .

today , we know that it is because our current economic system is so bureaucratic and often has very high taxation , that our companies invest outside the european union .
electromagnetic compatibility between rolling stock and control-command track-side equipment .
if we enter into new borrowings now , those loans will have to be repaid , and the money used to make the repayments will then not be available for investment .
we cannot continue to allow ever more young scientists to go to the united states and thus be lost to us .
because we have not yet reached any agreement on any of the old european common initiatives in the field of immigration .
this is what makes patenting software dangerous , and even more dangerous if the patent is to last for 20 years , which is a geological era in software development .
i also believe that we cannot adopt the proposal now because , if we do , the states will do their own thing .
according to national specifications
i do not believe that it was necessary to venture into the realms of complex formulae to define the distinction between software as such and software as a part of computer-implemented inventions .
because we do not believe in the need for european harmonisation , perhaps ?
the programme submitted for the province of udine in the region of friuli venezia giulia by italy on 2 may 2000 covering :
in such a case , the member state concerned shall provide additional information within one month .

in actual fact , it is the same with software and all other artistic activity which can of course be compared with the design of software programs in which the design itself is protected by copyright law .
if all existing patents had to be validated , then all software development would be restricted , limited and increasingly inhibited , since all small and medium-sized enterprises and programmers would be forced to buy rights or licences and virtually pushed out of the market .
information technology would suffer the same fate : with patents , every command , every sequence of codes and algorithms would be protected , and the market transformed into a web of restrictions .
where the document does not fall within paragraph 1 ( a ) or ( b ) and the general secretariat , in the light of the third party &apos;s negative opinion , is not satisfied that article 4 ( 1 ) or ( 2 ) of regulation ( ec ) no 1049 / 2001 is applicable , the council shall be seized of the matter .

the presidency may convene more frequently the groups that prepare coreper &apos;s proceedings , when required by circumstances .
on certain arrangements for the application of that agreement .
an electronic computer is an instrument which is used to create music , not composed of notes but of codes and commands , alternating with rhythm and a composed sequence , made by the developer , giving rise to different actions and results .
other dates ( tx ) may be specified depending on the tsi and the specific case .
this requirement shall be respected as rs design parameter and for rs subsystem assessment .
as mr manders has said , we are running up against the border between copyright and patentability .
it is a difficult problem and i think that the proposals that have been devised in the opinions by the committee on industry , external trade , research and energy and the committee on culture are the basis for our decision-making .
the presidency shall refrain from placing on coreper &apos;s agenda items for information only .
i very much want to invite reflection .
recommendations and opinions issued by the council shall include in their titles the word &quot; recommendation &quot; or &quot; opinion . &quot;
i will therefore begin by stating that i support , wholly and unequivocally , everything that has been said by the draftsman of the committee on culture , youth , education , the media and sport , mr rocard .
sanding for traction purposes on multiple units is not permitted ahead of the leading axle below 40km / h in the united kingdom , as defined in annex a , appendix 1 paragraph 4.1.4
mr president , commissioner , our starting point is also that we do not think that the patent is the right way to protect computer-implemented inventions .
let us be absolutely sure that what we send back from this debate and from tomorrow &apos;s vote - and mrs mccarthy has worked very hard on this report - really does provide a completely watertight seal against such leakage and protects what mr bolkestein wants to protect without creating the danger which so many of us have been taught to apprehend by our constituents .
form of regulations :
specific case
nobody wants a leakage resulting in the patenting of pure software .
article 11 ( 3 ) ( possibility of a member of the council acting on behalf of another in a vote ) ;
human knowledge and the dissemination thereof is an important freedom which we in europe must preserve .
these tighten the definition in such a way that , in my view , software as such is excluded .
cr rejected
it must be about technical innovation , and that is precisely the heart of the problem we are all facing .
our intensive work and the fact that it was monitored so closely by stakeholders has produced the compromise which i would encourage you to support and which is reflected in my group &apos;s proposed amendments .
the draft 18-month programme should also have regard , inter alia , to relevant points arising from the dialogue on the political priorities for the year , conducted at the commission &apos;s initiative . &quot;
in this , we are not starting from scratch , because the characteristics on which patents are based have already been clearly identified in the trips agreements .
pre-fitting may take advantage from additional interface specifications between the subsystems rolling stock and control-command .
justice and home affairs &#91; 21 &#93; ;
now to a second point : we have , of necessity , to deal with a complex international legislative framework and , if we look at what is happening , not just in europe but in the united states , in particular , the patent system is proving to have very many limitations , above all very many practical limitations .
cc trackside assembly
the decisions taken or the conclusions reached by the council ,
no , ladies and gentlemen , we do not want any general patenting of any software .

the programmes for the monitoring of tse ( bse and scrapie ) listed in annex iii shall qualify for a financial contribution from the community in 2007 .

however , only the legislator can bring this harmful trend to a halt .
ccb
annex 2 , schedule a , to the common consular instructions is hereby amended as follows :
it is true that in the past , the european patent office has handed out far too many patents far too lightly .
mrs mccarthy has cited the most recent example of amazon &apos;s &apos; one-click &apos; shopping method .
at present there is legal uncertainty on what is patentable and what is not in the area of software .
the aim of this proposal is to harmonise the european regulations .
&quot; for the council
the programme submitted by germany on 25 february 1999 covering :
article 14 ( 2 ) ( possibility for any member of the council to oppose discussion if the texts of any proposed amendments are not drawn up in the language he or she has specified ) .
for etcs there is no functional link between the two onboard systems except to manage transitions during train operation ( and with exception to satisfy the needs of the stms for class b systems when stms are used ) .
the generic requirements for such a plan are described in paragraph 7.3.7 below .
i am therefore asking you to support the standpoint of the committee on industry , external trade , research and energy , article 6a of the report , and of course the other amendments as well .
the possibility of linking equipment in order to achieve interoperability is a method of achieving an open network and preventing the misuse of dominant positions .
we want explicitly to exclude computer methods , algorithms and mathematical models from patentability , as set out in a new article 4 .
existing geometry of track circuit equipment
i would be the first to agree that we need more debate on and refinement of the proposed legislation .
preparation for meetings
we want to ensure interoperability to enable computer programmers to engage in reverse engineering practices and to decompile programs for experimental purposes without risking infringement or legal action .
at the start of a meeting , the presidency shall give any further information necessary regarding the handling of the meeting and in particular indicate the length of time it intends to be devoted to each item .
for the purposes of application of these rules of procedure , due account will be taken , in accordance with annex iv , of cases in which , under the treaties , one or more members of the council may not participate in the vote .
version releases
a small belgian company employing 12 people has written to me saying that it needs patents to get a return on its investment , to grow its business and to ensure that others respect its technology .
the detection of the presence of any type of circulation when running or at standstill is granted anytime if the mass of a lone vehicle or train-set is greater than 90 tons .
approval or amendment of council minutes ( article 13 ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) ) ;
this work relies on the feedback from current pilots , early commercial applications as well as on structured program of cross-tests with products from different suppliers .
that , i think , sounds wise , especially since the european patent convention does emphasise that software cannot be patented .
the secretary-general , assisted by the deputy secretary-general , shall have full responsibility for administering the appropriations entered in section ii - council - of the budget and shall take all measures necessary to ensure that they are properly managed .
council decision ( 2004 / 338 / ec , euratom ) of 22 march 2004 adopting the council &apos;s rules of procedure ( oj l 106 , 15.4.2004 , p . 22 ) .
agreement by the commission to the use of the written procedure shall be required where the written vote is on a matter which the commission has brought before the council .
see statement ( a ) set out below : ( a ) concerning article 2 ( 4 ) : &quot; the 18-month programme will include a general introductory section setting the programme in the context of the european union &apos;s longer term strategic orientations .

decision to use the written procedure ( article 12 ( 1 ) ) ;
it does sound as if we , in actual fact , all have the same intentions .
open point
mr president , commissioner , i should like to thank the rapporteur for the huge amount of work she has done .
article 17 ( 5 ) ( whether to publish in the official journal decisions taken by a body set up under an international agreement ) .
the presence of a majority of the members of the council who are , under the treaties , entitled to vote is required to enable the council to vote .
minimum dimension of metal mass and approval conditions of vehicles operating in germany and poland are given in annex a , appendix paragraph 3.3.1
a large number of these have been approved by the committee on legal affairs and the internal market in the debate on the mccarthy report .
these provisions are without prejudice to the role of the economic and financial committee as laid down in article 114 of the ec treaty and to existing council decisions thereon ( oj l 358 , 31.12.1998 , p . 109 and oj l 5 , 1.1.1999 , p . 71 ) .
the secretary-general , the deputy secretary-general or a director-general acting on their behalf shall send to the governments of the member states and to the commission authentic copies of council directives other than those referred to in article 254 ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) of the ec treaty and council decisions and recommendations .
the proposal by the committee on legal affairs and the internal market improves the directive on key points .
we should be aware of this .
what we need is a european patent law to promote innovation , one that contains clear and sensible rules and draws a watertight border against pure software .
there is a big difference between copyright and patent law .
the difference between the two was the use of language .
i hope that this does not mean that he will still be a little bit french from a functional point of view , because one would want him to defend the case of the euro in clear language in paris .
he is clearly an exceptionally talented , able and intelligent central banker .
the programmes for the eradication of scrapie listed in annex v shall qualify for a financial contribution from the community in 2007 .
the continuing economic difficulties in the eurozone are one of the many reasons why the uk should not abolish its national currency either .
our willingness to use the euro in the european union must be confirmed and increased every day .
i expect mr trichet to continue to follow this line in the future and to be consistent when it comes to the execution of the rules and to speak out clearly on this matter in paris too .
communicating with the driver
unanimity on the part of coreper shall be required for any derogation from that period &#91; 13 &#93; : ( a ) decision to hold a council meeting in a place other than brussels or luxembourg ( article 1 ( 3 ) ) ;
for purposes of fitment of etcs equipment &quot; major retrofitting &quot; is defined as those maintenance operations that entail an investment at least 10 times higher than the value of fitting the etcs equipment on that specific type of rolling-stock .
coreper shall be responsible for preparing the work of the council and for carrying out the tasks assigned to it by the council .
the proposal that mr kirkhope has submitted is a very balanced one , demonstrating due appreciation of the concerns that individuals have and taking them into account , whilst , however , guaranteeing that the rules imposed by immigration policy are actually complied with in the way that they must be .
it is not at all clear who has responsibility for ensuring that they are returned safely and continue to be safe .
annex ii is replaced by the text in annex ii to this decision .
we should also be aware that people are being removed from some of our member states for the very reasons for which we are supposed to protect them , for example on grounds of ethnicity in the case of the roma .
the governing council of the european central bank adopted its opinion on 31 july and forwarded it to the council and parliament .

( it ) mr president , ladies and gentlemen , commissioners , it is a pleasure to speak today on a matter of great importance for the european union : the appointment of the president of the european central bank .
in case tsi requirements for some interface ( s ) between control-command and signalling and other subsystems are not available at the moment of installation ( e.g. electromagnetic compatibility between train detection and rolling stock , climatic conditions and physical conditions in which the train can work , geometric parameters of the train like length , maximal distance of axles in the train , length of the nose of the first and of the last car of the train , braking parameters ) , the corresponding characteristics and the standards applied shall be indicated in the registers of rolling stock .
appointment of the ecb president
it is crucial for the european central bank and the euro that the selection of a successor to president duisenberg is carried out transparently and that it is based only on the criteria laid down in the treaty establishing the european community and in the statute of the european system of central banks and of the european central bank , and on the agreement of the latter on the candidate most qualified for the job .
an italian class b system built upon etcs components .
the euro is still a relatively new currency , and it will need to draw on the - widely recognised - experience of the european central bank to continue to be a success .
i am aware that a large number of amendments to the mccarthy report have been tabled , many of which seek to reintroduce ideas and themes already considered and rejected by the committee during the preparation of the report .
there are some interesting points but , in the main , i am afraid that the majority of those amendments will be unacceptable to the commission .
set the order in which items are to be taken and determine the duration of discussions on them ;
admission to meetings of the council shall be subject to the production of a pass delivered by the general secretariat .
it is clear that proceeding via this parliament would give european citizens a greater say in patent legislation , an area which is so crucial to our economy .
the proposal rejects that .
secondly , in the absence of harmonisation at community level , member states are very likely to pursue harmonisation at european level instead .
on the contrary , his impressive career to date is a full guarantee of his personal qualifications .
one would hope that the appointment would one day be made solely by parliament .
the downstream part of the astico river between the dam near to the pedescala bridge and the pria maglio dam is considered a buffer zone .
that responsibility , moreover , is in the hands of mr trichet .
it shall be for the presidency , any member of the council , or the commission to propose issues or specific subjects for such debates , taking into account the importance of the matter and its interest to citizens .
minimum axle load necessary to shunt certain track circuits is determined in a requirement of eba ( eisenbahn-bundesamt ) , relevant on some main lines in germany in the area of former dr ( deutsche reichsbahn ) with 42 hz and 100 hz track circuits according to the infrastructure register .
type of measure necessitating the transmission of information ( 1 ) ( * )
mr president , on behalf of the commission , i wish to begin by thanking mrs mccarthy , the rapporteur on this complex and technical but important matter , for her excellent work on this report .
policy debates in other council configurations on their priorities shall also be held in public .
i imagine that even mr trichet would agree that , without investment , the economic machine cannot restart and i imagine that he himself will note the delay in private investment and the need for us to give impetus to public investment , as mr chirac and mr schröder have finally understood , albeit belatedly .
public register of council documents
unfortunately , the same cannot be said of the economic philosophy which the candidate president of the european central bank defended before the committee on economic and monetary affairs with such obstinacy .
as things now stand , though , it can no longer be fitted in to its ideal slot in the timetable , and so i would welcome it if the attempt could be made - by you , too , commissioner , i would ask you - to sort out this problem with safe third states , if at all possible , when we deal , as we shortly will , with the procedural directive .
mr schmidt has clearly understood that parliament does not want to turn its attention away from really important matters , and that it is not prepared to take short-cuts which do not actually lead anywhere .

see statement ( l ) set out below : ( l ) re annex i , second subparagraph &quot; the presidency will organise council agendas by grouping together related agenda items , in order to facilitate attendance by the relevant national representatives , particularly where a given council configuration as to deal with clearly distinguishable sets of topics . &quot;
the acts referred to in the first paragraph of article 163 of the euratom treaty ;
mr president , the large-scale misuse of asylum is a very serious problem in the european union , and it would therefore be misplaced to discuss ad infinitum the gender of angels .
indeed , a new directive should be laid down about standards for the recognition of the refugee status as soon as possible , and we should apply minimum criteria in this respect , whereby the member states may , and can , apply stricter standards .
to foresee a period of transition of approximately 12 months where the two structures will operate in parallel following a modus operandi to be agreed between the two parties .
their interventions shall be brief , substantive and to the point .
resources should therefore be found in order to separate the wheat from the chaff , and the list of safe third countries is one of those .
in accordance with the provisions of the eu treaty , the secretary-general shall assist the council and the presidency in matters concerning the common foreign and security policy , including coordination of the work of the special representatives .
the final article of a regulation shall fix the date of entry into force , where that date is before or after the 20th day following publication .
it is an austrian initiative , drawn up by the austrian government , and , in consequence , some of the questions put to me by the honourable member cannot be answered by the commission , because this is not a commission proposal .
they may delegate their power to sign to directors-general of the general secretariat .
( pt ) mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i would like to thank mr schmidt for the concise and clear report he has presented on this austrian initiative .
the council has consulted experts who have analysed this issue , and i can say that there is an agreement in principle within the council in favour of discussing this matter more thoroughly during the next council meeting on 2-3 october .

the austrian initiative , however , poses a complex problem related to the use in the european asylum system of the concept of safe third countries .
that is what we all want .
this decision shall be published in the official journal .
this does not in any way affect the individual member states &apos; procedures .
nor is it a measure that tries to be ambitious or reviews the whole issue of asylum procedures as such , or indeed asylum criteria .
it is important to establish a clear legal framework for transit procedure in such cases , relating , for example , to the use of escorts and the individual competences of the transit airport .
the commission , therefore , intends to table a proposal for a council directive on minimum standards for repatriation procedures and mutual recognition of repatriation decisions .
radio in-fill unit
this proposal for a directive aims , therefore , to lay down measures that may be taken by the competent authorities to assist with escorted or unescorted removals at european transit airports .
article 3 &#91; 5 &#93; agenda
results of votes and explanations of votes , as well as the statements in the council minutes and the items in those minutes relating to the establishment by the council of a convention on the basis of title vi of the eu treaty .
coreper shall be chaired , depending on the items on the agenda , by the permanent representative or the deputy permanent representative of the member state which holds the presidency of the council .
it is important to underline the commission &apos;s role in intelligently implementing the scoreboard established for that area of freedom , security and justice .
the commission shall , once a year , prepare a general report summarizing the most relevant information transmitted by the member states .
this can be illustrated as a cascade process as follows :
31 december 2007 .
provisional agenda of committees and working parties ;
opinion delivered on 3 may 2006. not yet published in the official journal .
it is with that goal in mind , moreover , the goal of the directive on that procedure , that we must examine , analyse and debate all of these issues .
directives and decisions adopted jointly by the european parliament and the council , and directives and decisions of the council , shall include in their titles the word &quot; directive &quot; or &quot; decision . &quot;
a lack of coordination or cooperation has often meant much more suffering for the people concerned .
it has also meant that this operation has not always been carried out successfully .
up to now there have been considerable problems in achieving this .
the travelling arrangements require that assistance be afforded by moving those particular persons by air and transiting them through other european countries on the way back to where they have to go .
&quot; council framework decision , &quot; a serial number ( year / number / jha ) , the date of adoption and the subject-matter ;
the possibility for providing additional information referred to in paragraph 3 may also be used by the member states to provide information on measures not covered by the obligation referred to in paragraph 1 , on their own initiative or upon request of the commission or another member state .
officials have experienced frustration and difficulty over this , not only in britain but indeed in most eu member states .
impedance between wheels
furthermore , should we win the vote on this amendment - and as my colleague indicated , it was very close in committee - i trust that the council and the commission would respect the outcome and not carry out the threat made in committee by the commissioner &apos;s services to go for a different procedure , in effect acting behind parliament &apos;s back in seeking to persuade the council to do something which , so i understand , it does not want to do anyway .
i think this is an unnecessary measure .
train protection system ( class b to class a ) .
why is the commissioner seeking to reinvent the wheel when there are already satisfactory arrangements in place with the iea for a regime of maintaining oil reserves ?
the council shall be assisted by a general secretariat , under the responsibility of a secretary-general , who shall be assisted by a deputy secretary-general responsible for the running of the general secretariat .
when you know that even the opec countries do not manage to maintain the desired price level , this measure can only be described as wishful thinking on the part of the european union .
despite this , it seems more helpful to me to withdraw the proposal .
however , application of article 7 of the eu treaty is not covered by those provisions.in the first application of articles 43 and 44 of the eu treaty , the council will , in the light of experience acquired in other fields , consider any adaptations necessary to article 16 of and annex iv to these rules of procedure . &quot;
it would , in my view , take more than setting up a new body .
why would the european union increase its stocks when the international energy agency has a global emergency response mechanism at its disposal ?
supporting driving .
madam president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , nobody denies the fact that , given the eu &apos;s considerable dependence where the provisioning of natural oil products is concerned , initiatives must be taken to guarantee the continuity of supply of these products .
article 17 ( 4 ) ( c ) ( publication in the official journal of any measures implementing decisions or conventions referred to in article 34 ( 2 ) of the eu treaty ) ;
.throughout the legislative process , those who submit texts in connection with the council &apos;s proceedings shall pay special attention to the quality of the drafting .
the special circumstances obtaining in each member state have to be taken into account to ensure supplies of energy .
they have succeeded in organising matters efficiently and cost-effectively by other means .
as discussed earlier change is a fact of life for large software based systems .
that , thank god is a point on which we can agree .
the same applies to the european central bank in cases where it exercises its right of initiative .
the only thing is that i see such a situation as highly unlikely .
the measures necessary for the practical organisation of the european council &apos;s proceedings shall be taken by the presidency in liaison with the general secretariat , in accordance with the rules on which the european council itself has agreed .
i have , however , learned in the meantime that any benefit from this bears no relation to the cost involved , and the united states &apos; experience with its strategic petroleum reserve demonstrates that emptying the reserves has remarkably little effect on steeply rising prices .
new threats from terrorism and sabotage - as we have seen in iraq - and our increasing dependence on energy from outside the eu pose huge challenges .
items relating to the adoption of an act or a common position on a legislative proposal or a proposal for a measure to be adopted under title vi of the treaty on european union ( hereinafter referred to as the eu treaty ) shall not be placed on the provisional agenda for a decision until the six-week period provided for in point 3 of the protocol on the role of national parliaments in the european union has elapsed .
indeed , such a directive is needed because the current european union legislation does not provide for a community mechanism governing the use of oil stocks .
although member states certainly have responsibilities for securing their own energy supplies , the need for cooperation early in a crisis situation will be vital .
coreper shall avoid going over ground already covered in the preparation of its proceedings .
madam president , just how serious the issue of energy supplies is can be seen from the recent imperialist invasion in iraq and the squabbling both before and after over how to divide up the spoils .
in column 5 , the modules to be applied for conformity assessment , which are described in chapter 6 of this tsi .
if this is accepted , it will undermine still further the facility for energy planning based on the needs of each member state and will result in an energy sector structured in accordance with the choices of the strong powers of the european union .
the presidency and the businesslike conduct of discussions
such an indication shall be made once all the procedural requirements provided for by the treaties have been complied with .
any text adopted by the council and intended to be published in the official journal .
&quot; council common position , &quot; a serial number ( year / number / cfsp ) , the date of adoption and the subject-matter .
however , in order to facilitate migration and in the extent possible from a technical view point , different baselines should encompass a common core of functionality for which backward compatibility should be ensured .
let us never forget that the geneva convention gives every person his or her own unique right to seek asylum in a foreign country in order to escape persecution and suffering .
if , commissioner vitorino , the eu cannot successfully integrate immigrants and refugees and provide a framework for an asylum policy characterised by humanitarianism and legal certainty , we have a time bomb ticking away that is just waiting to explode into social and economic tensions within the eu and into external pressure from all those who are outside and want to come in .
neighbouring rbc
nor can it mean treating people who make their way to our part of the world as second-class citizens , moving them around and assembling them in camps outside the borders of the eu .
nor , however , can asylum policy mean our using gunboats to command vessels containing refugees to heave to or even , as one italian minister said , using them to fire on such vessels .
on 16 april 2003 , the ten member states signed the accession treaty in athens whereby the dublin ii regulation and the schengen regulation would , in future , apply to them .
member states shall communicate to the commission and the other member states information on the measures which they intend to take , or have recently taken , in the areas of asylum and immigration , where these measures are publicly available and are likely to have a significant impact on several member states or on the european union as a whole .
the added functionality that might be embodied in different baselines necessarily implies that different baselines are not backward compatible .
zona fosso de monterivoso : the water catchment area of the monterivoso river from its sources to the ferentillo dams .
mr president , i should like to thank the commissioner for her assurance on the point i raised .
i would like to add one comment following mr linkohr &apos;s remarks about prices : we should remember that the principal component in the price of oil is taxation .
unscrupulous traffickers in human beings must not be protected by the eu &apos;s asylum policy .
all of us want european asylum and refugee policy to be based upon humanitarianism and legal certainty .
versions of the system may have different functionality , performance or may repair system faults or safety or security shortcomings .
on a decision taken by the council or by coreper , acting by a qualified majority , the council shall hold public debates on important issues affecting the interests of the european union and its citizens .
, and in particular the second paragraph of article 13 of annex x thereto ,
the position of the gsm-r antenna on the roof of vehicles is mainly dependent on measurements that have to be carried out for any type of vehicle taking into account also the position of other ( new or existing ) antennas .
except as otherwise decided unanimously by the council on grounds of urgency , the council shall deliberate and take decisions only on the basis of documents and drafts drawn up in the languages specified in the rules in force governing languages .
the fact that we in the eu are starting to think in terms of solidarity and about security of supply is therefore something to be welcomed as a matter of principle .
hold a final preparatory meeting on the eve of the european council meeting and approve the agenda .
we cannot solve our energy problems by changing from oil to gas .
this decision shall enter into force on the 20th day following its publication in the official journal of the european union .
it is for each member state to determine the way in which it is represented in the council , in accordance with article 203 of the ec treaty .
parliament has recently discussed , at second reading , the gas directive , which deals with security of supply .
requests for consultations with the council made by another institution or a member state concerning an application for a council document shall be sent via e-mail to access @ consilium.europa.eu or by fax to ( 32-2 ) 281 63 61 .
reverse stm
the commission takes article 95 on the internal market as its basis .
i am not aware of anything having resulted from this .
if we stick with our policy of burning crude oil in an uncontrolled way , this dependency will increase to 95 % by 2020 .
madam president , as has already been noted , the eu is at present dependent on imports for 75 % of its crude oil .
any natural or legal person shall have access to council documents subject to the principles , conditions and limits laid down in regulation ( ec ) no 1049 / 2001 and the specific provisions laid down in this annex .
we take the view that , although there is a need for more solidarity between the member states and the commission can certainly do more as regards coordination , the use of article 95 on the internal market to justify additional competences for the commission in relation to petroleum products is not appropriate .
list of programmes of checks aimed at the prevention of zoonoses as referred to in article 2 ( 1 )
we therefore reject the idea of additional competences at eu level and hope that a majority in this house will back us in doing so .
the general report shall be transmitted to the european parliament and to the council .
this includes the factory-fit like operations associated to major maintenance exercises .
working revisions
biogas can be extracted on a local and decentralised basis from biogenous materials such as grass , biological waste , and wood .
i therefore basically welcome all three positions as provoking thought - an expression that has , i believe , already been used by those on the other side .
the open points indicated in this tsi will be managed in the revision process .
for that reason , i fear that , if we now send the directive back and the council nonetheless adopts a common position - which it can of course do - we will be pretty defenceless when it comes to second reading .
council deliberations open to the public and public debates
in view of the data submitted , 20 or 22 additional days at sea should be allocated to the netherlands for the period between 1 february 2006 and 31 january 2007 for vessels carrying on board beam trawls of groupings of fishing gears 4.b.i , 4.b.ii , 4.b.iii and 4.b.iv , according to whether they are or are not subjected to the special conditions laid down in point 8.1 . ( c ) , 8.1 . ( e ) and 8.1 . ( i ) of annex iia to regulation ( ec ) no 51 / 2006 .
then we will see what further progress we can make at second reading stage .
madam president , in my contribution to this debate , i want to concentrate on the subject of the gas supply directive , as mr karlsson , the rapporteur on crude oil , has had his group &apos;s agreement when dealing with this topic .
i do not therefore think that there is anything further to be added to what he had to say .
a number of illustrative examples are given below :
i can agree with it almost without reservation .
( visibility of track-side control-command objects )
i would thank the rapporteurs for their excellent work and i thank you all for your attention .
to move towards the conditions of &quot; critical mass &quot; for ertms / etcs to emerge as the natural market selection solution for new and upgrade signalling projects of the conventional rail network across europe .
for the interfaces to rolling stock see section 4.3.2.6 ( electromagnetic compatibility ) , for the interfaces to infrastructure see section 4.3.3.4 ( electromagnetic compatibility ) and for the interfaces to energy see section 4.3.4.1 ( electromagnetic compatibility ) .
member states shall make available the necessary information regarding their legacy systems that is required for purposes of development and safety-certification of apparatus allowing interoperability of class a equipment with their legacy class b facilities .
the measures provided for in this decision are in accordance with the opinion of the committee set up by directive 96 / 48 / ec ,
the reservations shall be indicated in the rolling stock register and / or infrastructure register as appropriate .
according to the new legislation , it is the member states that are required to offer security of supply .
if this new directive is implemented properly and enforced consistently , europe can avoid situations of the kind experienced in california .
migration strategies must pay special attention to the following distinction :
being part of the set of conventional rail priority projects established under the trans-european network guidelines included in annex ii of the decision no 884 / 2004 / ec ,
the commission would like to increase this obligation , but fails to make it clear why a higher stock level is necessary .
upgrading or renewal of the control-command track-side assembly or parts of it
tsi rolling stock freight wagons : not concerned .
lastly , it should be determined to what extent those who managed the crisis are liable .
compatibility with track-side train detection systems
the requirements for the conventional rail infrastructure and rolling stock register content with regard to the control-command assemblies are specified in annex c ( line specific and train specific characteristics ) .
the verification of the stm interface to the ertms / etcs on-board requires a conformity assessment carried out by a notified body .
the description of the modules is in annex e of this tsi .
environmental disasters of this magnitude underline the need for an eu coastguard .
the commission must , as a matter of urgency , obtain a negotiating mandate from the council .
excluded communication via eurobalises , radio in-fill and euroloop
the commission should propose an amendment to the united nations convention on the law of the sea , for which parliament would have much to propose .
it has to be said , actually , that most of the necessary legislation to promote safety at sea already exists .
see annex a , index 6 , 7 , 31 , 37 .
only euroloop communication with train
these functions shall be implemented in accordance with the technical specifications indicated in annex a , index 32 , 33 and 48 and their performance shall conform to annex a index 54 .
tsi rolling stock hs : section 4.2.4
this is just the sort of approach we need to ensure that something like this never happens again .
it would perhaps be useful if a temporary committee were to institute inquiries into incidents that have not resulted in disasters .
tsi rolling stock hs : section 4.2.4 ( to be added in )
this functionality is performed by rbc &apos;s , leu &apos;s and radio in-fill units ic &apos;s , according to the implementation
this is the information i have .
this tsi also contains functions that are needed to achieve operational interoperability ( see section 4.3.1 interface to the subsystem traffic operation and management ) .
regarding ertms / etcs the realisation of the etcs-net backbone as described in paragraph 7.2.2.4 shall constitute the reference baseline for the elaboration of such a national plan .
on the other hand , the countries supplying us are russia , algeria , libya , and the countries around the caspian sea , the stability of which is a matter of concern to the eu .
i regret having to say , madam vice-president , on behalf of the lead committee , that the proposal , as it stands , has found no supporters in this house , and that some of us reject it outright .
through a range of amendments , i have tried to find that balance between the member states and the common interest that is required if we are to achieve a solution that can work well for the oil market and in terms of the needs of the various countries .
that is how the debate on the proposal for a directive on security of supply for oil in europe might briefly be formulated .
the list of applicable technical rules mentioned in paragraph 1 for the &quot; open points &quot; referred to in annex g of the tsi ;
indicates , for the staff concerned , the professional qualifications and health and safety conditions at work required for the operation and maintenance of the subsystem concerned , as well as for the implementation of the tsi - chapter 4 ( characterisation of the subsystem ) .
cab radios that have additional interface-units for class b radio systems ( dual-mode ) are able to work also on lines in a class b network if specially designed .
the following additional clarifications apply to the use of some of the modules :
the proposal for enabling oil reserves to be released , even if there is no physical shortage , may appear sound at first glance , but it is clear , where this too is concerned , that such an arrangement would entail large problems and risks .
the market is not always right .
my proposal is based upon the need for increased coordination and the sharing of responsibility for oil supplies within the eu .
madam president , if parliament were to adopt this report on the proposal for a directive , including the proposed changes , we should , as a result , also have to cancel a number of previous directives , namely directives 68 / 414 / eec , 98 / 93 / ec and 73 / 238 / eec .
interface to data recording for regulatory purposes
open points in the tsi ;
nor do i see any reason why , in the future too , they should not be different .
in amendment no 28 , i therefore propose that it should be up to the member states to choose whether it should be a public body that has the task in question or whether it is for the individual member state to opt for another arrangement .
tsi rolling stock hs : section 4.2.4 , 4.3.13
verify that all optional functions required by the track-side or on-board specific implementation are implemented .
as a scandinavian , i usually only say thank you when there really is cause for doing so .
radio in-fill unit ( optional level 1 )
i therefore hope that the forthcoming progress report will support this .
port state control cannot operate unless it is independent and impartial .
only data recording for regulatory purposes
ladies and gentlemen , i would ask the commission to devote special attention to port state control in the forthcoming progress report on the candidate countries .
in the continued debate , it is important for us to recognise that we shall get nowhere concerning many sea areas in europe if the negotiations with third countries and with russia do not produce results .
radio-system ( for class b , only renewal is possible ) ,
furthermore , i want to inform you all , together with the commissioners , that the parliamentary assembly for the baltic states , which met at the beginning of september in uleåborg in finland , was in favour of rapidly phasing out single-hull tankers and declaring the baltic , or parts of it , to be a particularly sensitive sea area , or pssa , a matter also addressed in paragraph 25 of the report .
the resolution provides a clear analysis of the facts that resulted in the prestige disaster .
ten months on , we are debating the resolution which is the result of the investigation carried out by our fellow member dirk sterckx .
it is a thorough investigation , as he even went to speak to the captain of the prestige who was not , let us remember , permitted to attend the hearing of the transport committee .
i and my colleagues in our group are satisfied with the result .
the european agency for maritime safety is being given the mandate and the resources to act .
only now , after the summer , can estimates be made of the damage to the tourism sector .
registers of infrastructure
etcs and eirene air gap interfaces ( section 4.2.5 ) ,
data transmission is achieved by spot transmission ( eurobalise ) and in some cases by semi-continuous transmission ( euroloop or radio in-fill ) .
in very practical terms , the eu can do three things .
by classifying it in this way , it would be possible to take the necessary preventive measures to protect the area against dangerous transports of oil through its waters .
the verifications to be performed in case equipment is subject to exceptional stress ( e.g. exceedance of environmental conditions or abnormal shocks )
partly because of the limited quantity of water flowing through it , the baltic sea is just such an area .
i should like to ask the commissioner if contact has been made with the russian authorities and if there is any news - ideally good news - from them .
independently of the selected module , it shall be checked that the indications of the supplier for the maintenance of the interoperability constituent are compliant with the requirements of section 4.5 ( maintenance rules ) of this tsi .
mr sterckx has worked hard in drafting this report and , moreover , he , together with mr vermeer , has proposed many well justified amendments , which i hope the whole of parliament will support .
see annex a , index 5 , 41 , 55 .
all references to the tsi ope cr are open points and remain to be confirmed , when this tsi will be approved .
from next year the baltic sea will in practice be an internal sea of the union , a sea whose waters are completely replaced only once in a quarter of a century .
at the same time ferry traffic between helsinki and tallinn is on the increase , so now we urgently need the proposal promised by the commissioner for traffic arrangements in this sea .
rbc ( level 2 and 3 )
verification of correct operation off control-command assembly in the environmental conditions .
there were collisions just last winter : ships crashed into one another .
compatibility with driver &apos;s external field of view
consequently , there is a real danger that disasters will occur .
the baltic sea should also have special zones which these ships could traverse only with the protection of an escort , for example a pilot ship , with oil slick control facilities .
in particular , it is necessary to specify the stages to be completed in order to make a gradual transition from the existing situation to the final situation in which compliance with the tsi shall be the norm - chapter 7 ( implementation of the tsi control-command ) ;
for those rolling stock assets earmarked for operation in the trans-european transport conventional rail network as defined by the corrigendum of 7 june 2004 to decision no 884 / 2004 / ec .
control-command equipment shall not interfere with other control-command equipment .
the report is a balanced assessment of the events surrounding the prestige disaster and contains sound recommendations , whether on the prevention of such problems in the future or on ways of managing them more effectively .
it is a logical step to call for new rules and measures .
i shall return to this in a moment .
train protection system ,
the rapporteur is right in noting that erika legislation has not been able to prevent the prestige disaster , which is painfully similar to that involving the erika .
communication protocols ,
of great importance is the designation of safe havens , as well as the use of reception installations for excess oil in ports , which presuppose adequate payment schemes that are uniform throughout the european union for effective use .
data interfaces
what has become of this willingness to take action ?
let me reiterate that eur 214 million have been allocated to afghanistan for next year , thus discharging in full the obligations into which we entered at the donors &apos; conference in tokyo .
for at least 12 months preceding the date of export to the community , they have not been vaccinated with such vaccines ;
prevent any excrement escaping and reduce to a minimum any loss of feathers during transport ;
i also believe that we can also achieve consensus on other points relating to the conditions .
regulation ( ec ) no 853 / 2004 of the european parliament and of the council &#91; 3 &#93; lays down specific hygiene rules for food of animal origin .
for this we have allocated the same amount as this year .
within a 10 km radius of which , including , where appropriate , the territory of a neighbouring country , there has been no outbreak of avian influenza or newcastle disease for at least 30 days :
decision as last amended by decision 94 / 438 / ec ( oj l 181 , 15.7.1994 , p . 35 ) .
mr president , commissioner , mr president-in-office of the council , ladies and gentlemen , i would also like to say something about some of this budget &apos;s foreign policy aspects and will start by responding to mr poos , who said that the amendment tabled by the group of the european people &apos;s party ( christian democrats ) and european democrats is unacceptable in terms of the amount that it proposes for iraq , as a un mandate is required .
mr poos has evidently not read this amendment , which takes as its reference value the resolution that this house will be adopting tomorrow , it being a minimum precondition for the european union &apos;s involvement in iraq that there should be a un resolution , that the money should be put in a trust fund controlled by the world bank and the united nations , that the iraqi people should be involved in the processes of democratisation , in the adoption of a constitution and of the establishment of institutions , all of which are now needed , and , above all , that the oil industry should be placed in the hands of the united nations , in order that it may be a source of funding for the country &apos;s reconstruction .
there is clear evidence that the use of antibiotics for food-producing animals impacts on the occurrence of resistant bacteria in animals and in food and human exposure to these resistant bacteria results in adverse human health consequences .
in actual fact , this clause , formally included in agreements with third countries , is often disregarded by those who should be enforcing it .
pursuant to article 5 ( 2 ) of directive 2002 / 95 / ec , the commission has consulted the relevant parties .
either ( ( e ) have not been vaccinated against newcastle disease ; )
identification of container / seal number
to that end , the original of a declaration by the ship &apos;s master , drawn up in accordance with the addendum to part 3 of annex i , shall be attached to the veterinary certificate .
decision 93 / 342 / eec is amended as follows :
finally , in view of the fact that this draft community budget is the lowest , in relative terms , since 1987 , representing less than 1 % of community gross national income , i would like to know how the principle of economic and social cohesion in the european union will be safeguarded .
i assume that common sense will prevail in this house and that we will fix a higher amount than the council has in mind .
we need to identify women as a target group when thinking in terms of the visibility of information campaigns , particularly in elections , and that we should involve women in every area of foreign policy - for example , in the reconstruction of afghanistan and iraq .
in its resolution of 4 september , the european parliament insisted that the amount of appropriations for the european union should , within the framework of the draft forest focus regulation , be the same as in the previous 1992 regulation on the protection of forests from fires with a view to funding appropriate forest fire prevention measures .
we hope this proposal will be approved .
that , then , will be our proposal for the donors &apos; conference for up to the end of 2004 .
the reason i mention this is that it figured prominently in this debate last year .
her ( hatching eggs of ratites )
the commission &apos;s draft envisages a total of eur 507 million for humanitarian aid .
breeding and productive poultry other than ratites hatched from imported hatching eggs shall be kept for at least three weeks from the date of hatching in the hatchery or on the holding ( s ) to which the poultry has been sent after hatching .
poultry , hatching eggs and day-old chicks may only be imported into or transit through the community from third countries or parts thereof listed in columns 1 and 3 of the table in part 1 of annex i where column 4 of that table provides for a model veterinary certificate for the commodity concerned .
il - israel
this is described in the reports on the aid programmes .
where any bird tests positive , the whole contact group shall be destroyed .
( de ) mr president , mr president-in-office of the council , honourable members , recent years have already seen the common foreign policy become a priority in the budget debates , and that will be the case in the 2004 budget too .
raw milk containing antibiotic substances in excess of the maximum residue limits laid down in community legislation is unfit for human consumption and unsafe having regard to the fact that such maximum limits are based on the type and amount of residues considered to be without any toxicological hazard to human health .
serological examination : 60 birds to be sampled at the point of lay .
we are also concerned about the problems and irregularities in connection with eurostat and therefore want the european parliament to ask for 25 % of the appropriations to eurostat &apos;s administrative expenditure to be placed in title 31 ( &apos; reserves &apos; ) until the commission has given parliament sufficient assurance that the problems have been solved and that the people responsible have been identified and appropriately penalised .
the commission consequently considers , in view in particular of the result of the last inspection visit of the fvo on 26 and 27 september 2006 and taking into account the presence of the product in several member states , that the risk cannot be satisfactorily contained unless community-wide measures are taken , including the prohibition on the placing on the market of those products .
we also want to call upon the commission to ensure that additional funds for the information campaign concerning the euro are available if further needs should arise , for example as a consequence of referendums in any of those countries that do not at present have the euro .
as an aside , i regret that , following the result of the referendum last week , my own country , sweden , will not be eligible for funds for the information campaign concerning the euro .
paragraph 1 shall not apply to single consignments of fewer than 20 units of poultry , hatching eggs or day-old chicks .
commodities certified for :
