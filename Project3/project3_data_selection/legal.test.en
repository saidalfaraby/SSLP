in particular , with reference to iraq , injustices and violence must be condemned with equal force whatever their origin , whether terrorists or the occupying anglo-american forces are involved .
speaking of the silence on iran and on the human rights situation in iran , she said : &quot; silence is an insult to the victims . &quot;
disclosure of information under this regulation is subject to the specific requirements of regulation ( ec ) no 1049 / 2001 .
the courage of these people is essential to our learning of human rights abuses , and it is thus a prerequisite for the session in geneva .
it would be much to the european union &apos;s credit and advantage to emphasise those rights , which are connected with globalisation .
but why should they be mutually exclusive ?
these are only two examples to illustrate that in this world , still takes precedence over the major democratic and ethical principles to which no more than lip service is being paid .
grants ;
the depository bank shall manage the fund pursuant to a brief by the commission .
in africa , and this is a continent to which the european union apparently attaches special importance , a very clear test case of the seriousness of our resolve is zimbabwe .
&quot; third country &quot; means a state that is not a member state ;
prior notice must be given to the other joint owners ;
the voters &apos; rolls are out of date , the opposition has no idea where polling stations will be and to get food , people are forced to attend mugabe &apos;s rallies .
at the 61st session of the united nations commission on human rights in geneva , the eu should sponsor a specific resolution on zimbabwe and , in any case , use all means at its disposal over the coming vital weeks to ensure free and fair elections in that benighted country .
with regard to those countries , the un went as far as to adopt what is referred to as a no action motion .
we hardly dare to imagine , but certainly in the case of china , it is striking how there are those who , time after time , apply double moral standards .
the following criteria shall apply for the &quot; people &quot; programme :
on-site isolated intermediate : means an intermediate not meeting the criteria of a non-isolated intermediate and where the manufacture of the intermediate and the synthesis of ( an ) other substance ( s ) from that intermediate take place on the same site , operated by one or more legal entities ;
such information should be provided to a downstream user sufficiently in advance of the relevant registration deadline if the manufacturer or importer does not intend to register the substance , in order to enable the downstream user to look for alternative sources of supply .
we must bear in mind those young people who on st valentine &apos;s day distributed light-blue ribbons with gold stars on the streets of cities in belarus .
the european parliament must not resign itself to the creation of a new curtain on the borders of the european union , this time separating a democratic europe in which citizens can develop freely from an authoritarian europe in which political regimes violate basic human rights .
in the case of public bodies , research organisations , and higher and secondary education establishments , a certificate on the financial statements as required under paragraph 1 may be established by a competent public officer .
this leads me to make two comments .
the financial responsibility of each participant shall be limited to its own debt , subject to paragraphs 2 to 5 .
my second comment concerns effectiveness .
as for the countries involved - korea , burma and palestine - it seems to me essential to add to the list the democratic republic of the congo , which causes the equivalent of a tsunami every three months , with 3.6 million deaths since 1992 in an atmosphere of general indifference , and finally darfur , which is really starting to be the &quot; forgotten man &quot; in this context .
fair and reasonable compensation must be provided to the other joint owners .
ladies and gentlemen , i would like to draw your attention to the violation of human rights in belarus , one of the countries that shares borders with the european union .
if it fails to do so the commission may disseminate that foreground .
title i general issues
the evaluation provisions should provide for follow-up to registration , by allowing for checks on whether registrations are in compliance with the requirements of this regulation and if necessary by allowing for generation of more information on the properties of substances .
in the case of thematic programmes , the commission shall draw up thematic strategy papers as provided for in article 20 , and adopt action programmes as provided for in article 22 .
it is suitable in these circumstances that final decisions granting or refusing authorisations be adopted by the commission pursuant to a regulatory procedure in order to allow for an examination of their wider implications within the member states and to associate the latter more closely with the decisions .
talks on other initiatives to be presented by the eu will continue in the forthcoming meetings of the working group on human rights , which will be held prior to the session of the commission on human rights .
a system should be established in order to provide for the establishment of substance information exchange forums ( sief ) to help exchange of information on the substances that have been registered .
the european union has decided to present resolutions on the human rights situation in myanmar , the democratic people &apos;s republic of korea and the israeli settlements in the occupied territories .
where an application for a marketing authorisation is submitted in respect of a medicinal product designated as an orphan medicinal product pursuant to regulation ( ec ) no 141 / 2000 and that application includes the results of all studies conducted in compliance with an agreed paediatric investigation plan , and the statement referred to in article 28 ( 3 ) of this regulation is subsequently included in the marketing authorisation granted , the ten-year period referred to in article 8 ( 1 ) of regulation ( ec ) no 141 / 2000 shall be extended to twelve years .
within 30 days following receipt of the opinion of the paediatric committee , the applicant may submit to the agency a written request , citing detailed grounds , for a re-examination of the opinion .
the eu will be presenting thematic resolutions on religious intolerance , the death penalty and the rights of the child .
in accordance with the principle of proportionality , as set out in that article , this regulation does not go beyond what is necessary to achieve those objectives .
important as the eu &apos;s activities within the commission on human rights may be , this is nevertheless not the only means at its disposal for promoting human rights .
an mdg profile in country strategy papers and in its multiannual programming .
as in earlier years , it launched the largest number of initiatives : three initiatives on particular topics and ten initiatives on the human rights situation in various countries .
yesterday , a new international coordination conference involving the americans was announced .
i have received six motions for resolutions from six political groups to wind up the debate in accordance with rule 103 ( 2 ) of the rules of procedure ( 1 ) .
this also includes efforts to promote good forest governance and combat illegal logging , particularly through flegt , and innovative activities for the conservation and sustainable management of forests with active participation of local communities and forest dependent peoples .
the work programme shall establish the maximum number of participants and , where appropriate , the maximum number of researchers that may be used as the basis for the calculation of the maximum lump sum .
a board of appeal should be set up within the agency to guarantee processing of appeals for any natural or legal person affected by decisions taken by the agency .
at the end of 2004 , eur 1002 million was committed in the mediterranean and the middle east , including eur 160 million for iraq .
substances , on their own , in a preparation or in an article , which are subject to customs supervision , provided that they do not undergo any treatment or processing , and which are in temporary storage , or in a free zone or free warehouse with a view to re-exportation , or in transit ;
participation in indirect actions shall be open to international organisations and legal entities established in third countries provided that the minimum conditions laid down in this chapter are met , as well as any conditions laid down in the specific programmes or relevant work programmes .
the commission shall publish once a year in any appropriate medium the list of the independent experts that have assisted it for the seventh framework programme and each specific programme .
for indirect actions to support &quot; frontier &quot; research projects funded in the framework of the european research council , the minimum condition shall be the participation of one legal entity established in a member state or in an associated country .
the executive director should ensure the efficient execution of the agency &apos;s tasks in an independent manner .
my colleague from the council has already gone into great detail with regard to lebanon .
it is also necessary to ensure that generation of information is tailored to real information needs .
we provide help in the fields of education , health and job creation , and we often work with unrwa .
foreground arising from work carried out under indirect actions other than those referred to in paragraph 3 shall be the property of the participant carrying out the work generating that foreground .
the model grant agreement shall reflect the general principles laid down in the european charter for researchers and the code of conduct for the recruitment of researchers .
the quality and efficiency of the implementation and management .
there is a large number of topics and countries that could be discussed , and the excellent report by mrs flautre , which has our support , states parliament &apos;s priorities .
three members and three alternates appointed by the commission , on the basis of a public call for expressions of interest , after consulting the european parliament , in order to represent health professionals ;
for example , it is completely absurd that a rogue state such as libya has chaired the session on human rights .
this could perhaps be done in conjunction with the un overhaul in september .
as i conclude , i should like to call on the house to support the introduction of reproductive health rights into this report. i am addressing the more conservative members in particular .
whenever appropriate , the paediatric committee may request the applicant to supplement the particulars and documents submitted .
if the application complies with all the measures contained in the agreed completed paediatric investigation plan and if the summary of product characteristics reflects the results of studies conducted in compliance with that agreed paediatric investigation plan , the competent authority shall include within the marketing authorisation a statement indicating compliance of the application with the agreed completed paediatric investigation plan .
the dark side of globalisation - the exploitation of children , child labour , the trafficking of women , organ trafficking , the trafficking of human beings - must also be treated as a new threat to human rights .
the fight against terrorism must not violate human rights - we agree on this - but we must also bear in mind that terrorism , by definition and being a very present threat , is one of the biggest causes of fear , one of the biggest causes of insecurity and , in itself , an extremely violent attack on human rights .
i note , for example , that the human rights clause contained in the cotonou agreement is not solely concerned with the domestic human rights policies pursued by third countries but extends also to respect for human rights in the context of their international policies .
that the specific medicinal product does not represent a significant therapeutic benefit over existing treatments for paediatric patients .
we must concentrate our energies on rallying support for our initiatives amongst like-minded countries and the wider membership of the unchr in an effort to avert further defeats .
parliament &apos;s resolution also makes the point that the fact that the eu engages in a human rights dialogue should not preclude support for a unchr resolution on a particular country : the co-sponsorship by all 25 eu member states of canada &apos;s resolution on iran at last year &apos;s un general assembly third committee demonstrates that this principle is not neglected in practice .
usd 825 in 2004 )
it is also important that we encourage others to take responsibility for running resolutions on key issues of concern - the lead taken by switzerland as regards the resolution on nepal last year is a good example .
it is important that the eu prepares its strategy well and parliament &apos;s resolution and debate serve to stimulate those efforts .
we are all aware that the eu faces a range of challenges , not least the growing hostility of many unchr member states to the very concept of country resolutions , a development thrown into sharp relief by the rejection of the eu &apos;s draft resolutions on chechnya and zimbabwe at last year &apos;s unchr .
i would underline that the eu is responsible for the lion &apos;s share of country resolutions and it is not realistic to expect it to expand that list indefinitely .
the objective of the thematic programme on food security shall be to improve food security in favour of the poorest and most vulnerable people and contribute to achieving the mdg on poverty and hunger , through a set of actions which ensure overall coherence , complementarity and continuity of community interventions , including in the area of the transition from relief to development .
this is a concern which deserves greater attention in the framework of the european union &apos;s political dialogue with third countries and in our relations with the office of the high commissioner for human rights and other organisations .
in the case of indirect actions in the field of security research , the grant agreement may lay down specific provisions in particular on changes to the consortium &apos;s composition , confidentiality , classification of information and information to member states , dissemination , access rights , transfer of ownership of foreground and the use thereof .
we have to build jointly the walls of the house within which our peoples live .
in the absence of any indication to the contrary , the manufacturer or importer of the substance or the producer or importer of articles may manufacture or import the substance or produce or import the articles not earlier than two weeks after the notification .
the substance is present in those articles above a concentration of 0,1 % weight by weight ( w / w ) .
it is not going to be easy for us to do this , but i know that , by going together down this path , in this direction , we will be able to achieve our final goal .
cosmetic products as defined in directive 76 / 768 / eec ;
chapter 1 objectives and general rules
you , yourselves , have been the witnesses to the emergence of this new colour on the european map - the colour orange .
payment , distribution , recovery and guarantees
mr morillon did not take this into account when tabling his amendment and i think it is important .
with this further agreement , which the rapporteur endorses , we are taking another necessary step on the road towards fully integrating the new member states .
- mr president , i merely wanted to make a comment concerning the presentation of the oral amendment tabled by mr morillon. it has just been voted on and we support it .
chapter 1 authorisation requirement
where amounts are due to the community by a participant , the commission may , without prejudice to penalties which may be imposed on the defaulting participant in accordance with the financial regulation , either :
&quot; rtd performer &quot; means a legal entity carrying out research or technological development activities in funding schemes for the benefit of specific groups as identified in annex iii to decision no 1982 / 2006 / ec .
do not believe those who say that ukraine moving into european structures is against the interests of russia .
it is the only path open to us to bring us closer to the european union .
to receive the community financial contribution and to distribute it in accordance with the consortium and grant agreement ;
if the implementation of an action becomes impossible or if the participants fail to implement it , the commission shall ensure the termination of the action .
one of those instruments is lifelong learning .
the commission or the relevant community body shall make information equivalent to that required by article 10 available to the agency for substances regarded as registered according to article 15 .
the member states have negotiated a new version of the seafarers &quot; identity documents convention of the international labour organisation , aimed at simplifying the formalities involved in going ashore in countries of which they are not nationals .
the registrants may decide themselves whether to submit the information specified in article 10 ( a ) ( v ) and ( b ) and any relevant indication under article 10 ( a ) ( viii ) separately or whether one registrant is to submit this information on behalf of the others .
as regards the issue of the &quot; model &quot; chosen , which consists of a fingerprint printed as numbers on a bar code , there is no interoperability problem , either with passports or with visas , since fingerprints will be included in both proposals , hence they are comparable .
where any of the other participants demonstrate that their rights would be adversely affected , the intended transfer shall not take place until agreement has been reached between the participants concerned .
consequently we broadly agree with the proposals contained in the report .
the carriage of dangerous substances and of dangerous preparations by rail , road , inland waterways , sea or air should also be excluded from its scope as specific legislation already applies to such carriage .
mr president , we are in the habit of making a lot of noise when it comes to the explanations of vote .
in the case of indirect actions to support training and career development of researchers , the grant agreement may lay down specific provisions on confidentiality , access rights and commitments relating to the researchers benefiting from the action .
the distribution of the community financial contribution ;
i feel that they will constitute another positive step in the euro-mediterranean partnership .
funding decisions shall be made on the basis of this ranking .
. - the commission is proposing that the council authorise the member states falling under the eu &apos;s common visa , asylum and immigration policy ( including sweden ) to ratify , in the interests of the community , the seafarers &quot; identity documents convention of the international labour organisation .
in compliance with article 31 ( 3 ) , point ( c ) , a participant may use a simplified method of calculation of its indirect eligible costs at the level of its legal entity if this is in accordance with its usual accounting and management principles and practices .
the convention does not imply any change to the regulation governing the area , which expressly lays down exceptions from the visa requirement for civilian sea crews .
following the work already done at first reading , and in light of the cooperative work carried out with the council , i believe that this report should be adopted , given that the issue before us , relating mainly to a harmonised risk assessment system , strengthens the security of the community &apos;s external borders , an issue of vital importance to all of us .
the june list does not , therefore , see anything to prevent the member states from making their own decisions on whether they wish to accede to the convention , without authorisation from the eu .
chapter 3 rules for phase-in-substances
subject to its obligations concerning confidentiality , where the participant is required to pass on access rights , it shall give prior notice to the other participants in the same action , together with sufficient information concerning the new owner of the foreground to permit them to exercise their access rights under the grant agreement .
where a full study report is available , a study summary shall be submitted ;
my view on this issue , like that of the rapporteur , is not entirely devoid of doubts .
in accordance with directive 86 / 609 / eec , it is necessary to replace , reduce or refine testing on vertebrate animals .
joint submission of data on isolated intermediates by multiple registrants
. article 3 ( j ) of the ec treaty states that the activities of the union should include the promotion of coordination between employment policies of the member states with a view to enhancing their effectiveness by developing a coordinated strategy for employment .
however , in the case of non-profit public bodies , secondary and higher education establishments , research organisations and smes , it may reach a maximum of 75 % of the total eligible costs .
mr president , honourable members , the commission declares that , with a view to ensuring that business operators in the european union are not placed at a competitive disadvantage to business operators outside of it , it will involve business representatives and trade federations in the legislative process that will lead to the adoption of provisions allowing the amendment of the community customs code .
access rights for implementation of indirect actions
transported isolated intermediate : means an intermediate not meeting the criteria of a non-isolated intermediate and transported between or supplied to other sites ;
access rights to background and foreground
he has been provided with the information in accordance with articles 31 or 32 relating to the exported substance ;
it could close mouths when they should be open .
if that is what the situation is like now , how far will we go when our dependence increases and we are competing more and more alongside china and india for russia &apos;s energy resources ?
to achieve fair burden sharing with their customers , manufacturers and importers should in their chemical safety assessment address not only their own uses and the uses for which they place their substances on the market , but also all uses which their customers ask them to address .
we all have birthdays from time to time , but we are not all called upon to play a leading role in events such as those your country has just experienced .
the signal is clear : europe is committed to considering vocational training one of its trump cards in order to win the battle of international competition , and to this end it is sending out a message to the enterprises and individual countries of the union .
everyone is aware of the merit of the proposal and it is commendable that we have managed to reach an honourable compromise between the commission , the council and parliament , which means that parliament can vote - i hope with the broadest possible majority - for this report .
it is necessary to consider the application of article 2 ( 7 ) ( a ) and ( b ) and annex xi to substances derived from mineralogical processes and the review of annexes iv and v should fully take this into account .
preservation of european competitiveness and ethical principles
in any case , however , the downstream users should consider the use and identify and apply appropriate risk management measures .
most member states are a long way off the 7 % mark of development cooperation .
it shall also establish , in accordance with the same conditions , the rights and obligations of legal entities who become participants when the indirect action is ongoing .
it should also be possible not to submit certain information if appropriate justification can be provided .
title xi classification and labelling inventory
they are simply asserting their basic human rights : in this case the right to assemble and practise a religion .
these people are not responsible for civil disorder and do not pose a threat to others .
regarding china , i would like to mention a small detail : two words that cause immense suffering .
duties of the commission , the agency and registrants of substances regarded as being registered
the agency should provide the infrastructure needed for natural or legal persons to meet their obligations under the data-sharing provisions .
coordination and support actions relating to the appointment of independent experts ;
ukraine and the european union should not forfeit this single and unique opportunity .
in addition , it is necessary to instil confidence in the general quality of registrations and to ensure that the public at large as well as all stakeholders in the chemicals industry have confidence that natural or legal persons are meeting the obligations placed upon them .
in cooperation with member states , the agency should give priority to certain substances , for instance those which may be of very high concern .
ukraine can make an official request on the basis of article 49 of the european union treaty , and we can do our utmost to meet the copenhagen criteria .
we feel that it is important for our own aspirations to be supported .
we are the ones who have to make the effort , and if we cannot implement quick reforms , the european union will not be able to help us .
i would emphasise once again that we understand that most of the work for joining the european union will fall to us .
the commission , in close cooperation with industry , member states and other relevant stakeholders , should develop guidance to fulfil the requirements under this regulation related to preparations ( in particular with regard to safety data sheets incorporating exposure scenarios ) including assessment of substances incorporated into special preparations - such as metals incorporated in alloys .
the scope and dimension of our relations should be based on the fact that ukraine is an integral part of a united europe already .
the grant agreement may provide that the reimbursement of indirect eligible costs is to be limited to a maximum percentage of the direct eligible costs , excluding the direct eligible costs for subcontracting , in particular in the case of coordination and support actions , and , where appropriate , actions for training and career development of researchers .
our people were able to choose the path of freedom and truth , showing that they were able to fight and to do their utmost to live in a europe which is united and free .
it is not just a question of geography , it is a question of our spiritual values , of our shared moral values too .
methodologies to establish thresholds for carcinogenic and mutagenic substances may be developed taking into account the outcomes of rips .
in true ukrainian fashion i would like to thank you for your support and for your struggle for our freedom .
democracy won the day even though it cost the people of my country and me myself a lot of effort .
journalists , politicians , businessmen , judges , public servants , all became mobilised , thanks to the establishment of what is almost a new nation , that is to say ukraine .
that is why we need to add to full membership the development of other options , such as article 47 and a sensible neighbourhood policy including the possibility of participation in the european economic area .
&quot; specific groups &quot; means the beneficiaries of &quot; research for specific groups &quot; identified in the specific programme and / or work programme ;
today , a remarkably large number of those who supported the idea of ukraine joining the european union were the same people who , yesterday , did not vote in favour of the constitution .
that means , though , that the european union must create the conditions under which that can happen - and this is where i urge this house to help .
the commission may , if deemed appropriate , select any individual with the appropriate skills from outside the lists .
full study report : means a complete and comprehensive description of the activity performed to generate the information .
signature and accession
registration of transported isolated intermediates
distributor : means any natural or legal person established within the community , including a retailer , who only stores and places on the market a substance , on its own or in a preparation , for third parties ;
the saying goes : &quot; glory to the victor , honour to the vanquished ! &quot;
all available and relevant information on substances on their own , in preparations and in articles should be collected to assist in identifying hazardous properties , and recommendations about risk management measures should systematically be conveyed through supply chains , as reasonably necessary , to prevent adverse effects on human health and the environment .
in this europe of ours , of course , balances have to be struck and bridges built in order to prevent new tensions from arising , including with our great neighbours in the east .
the fund shall be considered as a sufficient guarantee under the financial regulation .
where it goes once it has it is for the people themselves to decide .
unfortunately , after the commissioner &apos;s speech today i can only conclude that , to put it mildly , we still lack this courage .
as a member of the council of europe , i have for ten years had the opportunity to monitor various elections and this has been a critical period for some countries , i might mention the elections in croatia , albania or even the last parliamentary elections in ukraine .
experience with similar community agencies provides some guidance in this respect but the structure should be adapted to meet the specific needs of this regulation .
questions will also be asked regarding the external bodies that profited most from mr yushchenko &apos;s election .
international organisations and legal entities established in third countries
the second is decentralisation , which should prevent the country from splitting .
information on risk management measures applied and recommended to the user in accordance with paragraph 4 .
i think it would be a mistake to send them this message .
with their orange revolution , the ukrainian people have raised , and are raising now , the issue of our capacity to respond to the aspirations created by ourselves .
whether we can be proud of our involvement will become apparent from future events , yet what does the future hold ?
the handshakes with mr yushchenko before cameras on independence square and the orange orgy in this house , to which the media devoted much space , made it quite plain to ukrainians that we were not neutral .
save where otherwise provided in the call for proposals , all participants in an indirect action shall conclude an agreement , hereinafter &quot; the consortium agreement , &quot; to govern inter alia the following :
finally , i should like to emphasise that there will also be a great need for free and independent media , and that the new president and the government that is to be formed will need to set to building and strengthening the market economy and the constitutional state .
guidance on safe use of the substance as specified in section 5 of annex vi ;
i should like to underline that 300 000 ukrainians were also involved in this electoral observation , which is quite a gigantic effort .
i should like to have this confirmed by you , because , should that not be the case , let it be clear that we too would call for the action plan to be renegotiated .
the commission shall , in close cooperation with member states , establish a model grant agreement in accordance with this regulation .
i believe that mr yushchenko &apos;s victory is a victory for our european values .
ukraine &apos;s unshakeable desire to join the ranks of democracy will cause a shake-up in our policies , commissioner .
those who marched in favour of democracy , marched in favour of brussels rather than moscow , and i think that we should give due consideration to this in our policy .
the commission and the agency should ensure that reduction of animal testing is a key consideration in the development and maintenance of guidance for stakeholders and in the agency &apos;s own procedures .
the model grant agreement shall provide for supervision and financial control by the commission or any representative authorised by it , and the court of auditors .
finally , the correct manner in which the elections were conducted made it an especially great day for democracy .
information on intrinsic properties of substances may be generated by means other than tests , provided that the conditions set out in annex xi are met .
finally , we should offer ukraine the prospect of membership .
these measures should act as a strong incentive for continuing and far-reaching political and economic reforms in ukraine .
in such cases , the dissemination activity may not take place unless appropriate steps are taken to safeguard these legitimate interests .
today , the challenges , like the expectations - of reforms and democracy - are huge .
where the community financial contribution to networks of excellence takes the form of a lump sum , it shall be calculated according to the number of researchers to be integrated in the network of excellence and the duration of the action .
the minimum conditions for indirect actions shall be the following :
day after day and evening after evening , hundreds of thousands of ukrainians gathered and mobilised to demand quite simply that they be able freely to exercise their right to vote .
the chemical safety report shall document the chemical safety assessment which shall be conducted in accordance with paragraphs 2 to 7 and with annex i for either each substance on its own or in a preparation or in an article or a group of substances .
i hope that this democratic process will also prove an incentive to ukraine &apos;s neighbouring states , specifically to belarus .
pursuant to the implementation plan adopted on 4 september 2002 at the johannesburg world summit on sustainable development , the european union is aiming to achieve that , by 2020 , chemicals are produced and used in ways that lead to the minimisation of significant adverse effects on human health and the environment .
what i found impressive and heartening was that the interest and involvement of women in this democratisation process and at the polling stations went without saying .
this is in accordance with the wishes of the overwhelming majority of the ukrainian people , and could eventually culminate in ukraine &apos;s accession to the eu .
at the same time , in addition to the european neighbourhood policy , we have to offer ukraine other forms of association that will open the door to closer cooperation .
substances on their own or in preparations , registered in accordance with title ii , exported from the community by an actor in the supply chain and re-imported into the community by the same or another actor in the same supply chain who shows that :
appropriate measures shall be taken to ensure reasonable gender balance when appointing groups of independent experts .
there is a long and rocky road ahead of ukraine , but it is the right road .
firstly , ukraine , as poland &apos;s closest neighbour and thus a neighbour of the european union , must be offered a privileged status and an easy-to-understand &quot; road map &quot; of its journey to membership , even if this road will take many years to travel .
yet it is now time for the celebrations to end and the hard work to begin .
ukraine &apos;s entry into the world trade organisation must be encouraged .
where a participant who is not the owner of the foreground invokes its legitimate interest , it must , in any given instance , show that it would suffer disproportionately great harm .
the community may provide financial support , as established in the financial regulation , inter alia by means of :
ukraine &apos;s so-called orange revolution is as politically significant as the fall of the berlin wall or the end of the soviet union .
in such cases , the commission may , with the consent of the participant concerned , assume ownership of that foreground and adopt measures for its adequate and effective protection .
significant changes in the move towards democratisation have already had an impact on the supreme court , security services and media .
wide-spread public participation has helped ukraine to achieve tasks for which revolutions have in the past been necessary .
there have been public demands for the right to mobilise the people not only in action against fraud in the presidential elections , but also demands for democracy and the rule of law .
in particular , the commission shall monitor the implementation of the plan for the use and dissemination of foreground , submitted pursuant to the second subparagraph of article 20 ( 1 ) .
ukraine will never be the same again .
so we see ukraine , 15 years after 1991 , being given a second chance in the form of a new start .
participant guarantee fund
i was with parliament &apos;s delegation in the electoral districts to the south of kiev and can confirm that the election not only ran peacefully , but also in a very correct manner .
- mr president , it is very appropriate to quote the bible in this debate , for there were glad christmas tidings from kiev , announcing the birth of democracy and freedom .
the substance is not subject to paragraph 1 .
in order to ensure transparency , impartiality and consistency in the level of enforcement activities by member states , it is necessary for member states to set up an appropriate framework for penalties with a view to imposing effective , proportionate and dissuasive penalties for non-compliance , as non-compliance can result in damage to human health and the environment .
paragraphs 1 to 5 shall not apply to substances that have already been registered for that use .
an affiliated entity established in a member state or associated country shall also have access rights , referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 , to foreground or background under the same conditions as the participant to which it is affiliated , unless otherwise provided for in the grant agreement or consortium agreement .
yet ukraine is a powerful country in eastern europe , and recent events in this country can easily be compared to another fall of the berlin wall , albeit the berlin wall in the east .
the coordinator shall keep records making it possible to determine at any time the portion of the community funds that has been distributed to each participant .
to ensure workability and to maintain the incentives for waste recycling and recovery , wastes should not be regarded as substances , preparations or articles within the meaning of this regulation .
any manufacturer or importer of a polymer shall submit a registration to the agency for the monomer substance ( s ) or any other substance ( s ) , that have not already been registered by an actor up the supply chain , if both the following conditions are met :
work is now getting underway to put the revolutionary slogans into practice , and the consent of both the opposing camps is needed .
the criteria in annex xiii should be reviewed taking into account the current and any new experience in the identification of these substances and if appropriate , be amended with a view to ensuring a high level of protection for human health and the environment .
we must hold realistic talks and cooperate with the united states , and we must also hold realistic talks with russia in order to ensure that it views the developing situation in ukraine as an opportunity and not merely a threat .
exemptions from the obligation to register in accordance with article 2 ( 7 ) ( b )
in those regions , such languages sometimes enjoy official status and in certain cases they have a number of speakers , a literary tradition and a vitality comparable to those of national languages which enjoy official eu status , even though the latter may actually have only a similar or even a smaller number of speakers .
please excuse my poor pronunciation .
manufacturer : means any natural or legal person established within the community who manufactures a substance within the community ;
the technical dossier referred to in article 10 ( a ) shall include under points ( vi ) and ( vii ) of that provision all physicochemical , toxicological and ecotoxicological information that is relevant and available to the registrant and as a minimum the following :
the new overall legislation needed to remedy these problems is being prepared .
although religious freedom is guaranteed by the constitution of the republic of turkey , as indicated by the european commission in its 2004 regular report , non-muslim religious communities , including the ecumenical patriarchate , continue , however , to encounter obstacles and are subject to a bureaucratic regime .
chapter 2 substance evaluation
- madam president , mr president-in-office of the council , my heartfelt thanks for your detailed reply .
the council was then invited to reach an agreement on this framework with a view to opening the negotiations on 3 october 2005 in accordance with the procedures indicated in the european council &apos;s conclusions .
madam president , mr president-in-office of the council , in reply to your comments i would merely like to say that the proposal we currently have on the table does not take sufficient account of parliament &apos;s resolution .
when the time comes , the commission will have to report to the council on any failure in this area .
this is far from being the case .
substances , on their own , in preparations or in articles , which have been registered in accordance with title ii and which are recovered in the community if :
i should therefore like to ask whether the present proposal you are drafting will differ in any way from what we have already seen .
in its september conclusions , the council also expressed its point of view regarding the commission &apos;s reply to the high level group of experts chaired by professor marimon , responsible for assessing the effectiveness of the instruments used to implement the sixth framework programme .
having due regard to article 3 , the commission shall , upon request , make available to any member state or associated country any useful information in its possession on foreground arising from work carried out in the context of an indirect action , provided that the following conditions are met :
the agency should have the means to perform all the tasks required to carry out its role .
;
i would like to thank the president-in-office for an extremely comprehensive reply to my question .
specific provisions
and , if so , will he put his personal commitment behind it to persuade his colleagues in the 24 other countries that this is an idea worth pursuing .
in order to be considered eligible , costs incurred in the implementation of an indirect action must meet the following conditions :
this programme comprises a series of measures designed to perfect coordinated and effective maritime border management as quickly as possible .
the grant agreement shall establish the respective rights and obligations of the participants with regard to access rights , use and dissemination , in so far as those rights and obligations have not been laid down in this regulation .
financial interest generated by the fund shall be added to the fund and shall serve exclusively for the purposes set out in point 3 of the annex , without prejudice to point 4 thereto .
oj l 124 , 20.5.2003 , p . 36 .
we in the european parliament have frequently called for the creation of a european coastguard service , which , as well as dealing with the needs of those people whose precarious situation obliges them to try to enter europe by crossing our seas with difficulty , could also help to control the sea pollution affecting our coasts .
as a food additive in foodstuffs within the scope of council directive 89 / 107 / eec of 21 december 1988 on the approximation of the laws of the member states concerning food additives authorised for use in foodstuffs intended for human consumption &#91; 33 &#93; ;
the people in my country , as from april onwards , will be seeing people crossing over continuously , day after day .
the classification and labelling for any substance either subject to registration or covered by article 1 of directive 67 / 548 / eec and placed on the market should therefore be notified to the agency to be included in the inventory .
therefore , the registration provisions should require manufacturers and importers to generate data on the substances they manufacture or import , to use these data to assess the risks related to these substances and to develop and recommend appropriate risk management measures .
it is also , in my opinion , necessary , within the framework of the financial perspectives , to provide for the financial resources necessary for implementing a policy along these lines with a view to bringing european solidarity into play at this level .
in order to ensure the smooth functioning of that system they should fulfil certain obligations .
if ukraine fully respects its commitments , as expressed in the action plan , the commission is willing to help ensure that the european neighbourhood policy results in significantly enhanced relations between the european union and ukraine .
the substance being re-imported is the same as the exported substance ;
recent dramatic events in ukraine have reconfirmed the country &apos;s place on the european map .
for other substances in that quantity range there should be incentives to encourage manufacturers and importers to provide this information .
we hope that the eu-ukraine cooperation council meeting on 21 february will endorse this action plan , thereby paving the way for ukraine and us to begin work on its implementation .
from the commission &apos;s point of view , this proposal should , as far as possible , also take into account ukraine &apos;s requests .
principles to be followed in this respect shall be set out in the model grant agreement .
the numerous expressions of sympathy and support should be transformed into decisive and rapid action , and it should not be forgotten that time is a key factor .
we therefore expect both the council and the commission to undertake immediate measures .
given the changes that have taken place , it would be wholly inadequate to offer ukraine the old action plan .
eu citizens should have access to information about chemicals to which they may be exposed , in order to allow them to make informed decisions about their use of chemicals .
recent events have demonstrated the ukrainian people &apos;s strong attachment to democracy .
it also lays down rules , in accordance with those laid down in the financial regulation and the implementing rules concerning the community financial contribution to participants in indirect actions under the seventh framework programme .
we very much welcome this development .
the political compromise reached on 8 december 2004 was important in that it paved the way for a new second round of the presidential elections .
the situation posed a threat to the country &apos;s legal framework and its territorial integrity , but both of these were preserved .
it will allow us to shift to a higher gear in cooperation with ukraine .
the european neighbourhood policy is distinct from membership .
in the interests of clarity and as a starting point for this new accelerated restriction procedure , all the restrictions developed under that directive should be incorporated into this regulation .
through the developments of the past weeks the people of ukraine have already clearly demonstrated their commitment to the development of ukraine into a society that fully respects democracy and fundamental freedoms .
deadlines for the registration of these substances should therefore be set .
the identity of the substance as specified in sections 2.1 to 2.3.4 of annex vi ;
amounts transfered from the fund will be regarded as community financial contribution ; or
a manufacturer or importer may submit the information referred to in article 17 ( 2 ) ( c ) or ( d ) and article 18 ( 2 ) ( c ) or ( d ) separately if :
the sitting is closed .
yesterday an event occurred which caused something of a sensation .
this is the second time this has happened to me and the third time it has happened to my colleague mr aylward .
if question time starts late , then it should continue for a certain specific amount of time .
however , participants over and above the maxima for the establishment of the financial contribution may participate as appropriate .
restrictions on the placing on the market and the use of substances which are carcinogenic , mutagenic or toxic to reproduction , category 1 or 2 , for their use by consumers on their own or in preparations should continue to be introduced .
we will take this very seriously , and will request that all members keep to their speaking times and do not allow debates to overrun .
for research and technological development activities , the community financial contribution may reach a maximum of 50 % of the total eligible costs .
liability , indemnification and confidentiality arrangements between the participants .
the quaestors have already been informed of yesterday &apos;s incident , and it will be investigated by them .
where appropriate , the application of annex xvii of this regulation should be facilitated by guidance developed by the commission .
the next item is the commission statement on the results of the ukraine elections .
i thank the president-in-office for the clarity of his answer in listing the countries concerned .
then it would not be a community burden ; it would be a burden on the member states .
this is , moreover , something of that pragmatic approach i suggested to the honourable member from spain .
i must add that it will in fact be possible to publish the basic legal texts , the treaties and - one day , i hope - the constitution in all the languages of the european union .
for &quot; frontier &quot; research projects , experts shall be appointed by the commission on the basis of a proposal from the scientific council of the european research council .
you are entirely right , mr martin , and i share your views on the matter .
through a committee for risk assessment and a committee for socio-economic analysis , the agency should take over the role of the scientific committees attached to the commission in issuing scientific opinions in its field of competence .
it is a shame if we continue to allow this process of squeezing question time out of our business .
i will , however , take a note of your comments , and raise the matter with the bureau as requested .
the monitoring and evaluation referred to in article 7 of decision no 1982 / 2006 / ec shall include aspects relating to the application of this regulation , in particular aspects relevant for smes , and shall address the budgetary impact of the changes in the cost calculation regime as compared to the sixth framework programme and its effects on the administrative burden for participants .
substances included in annex iv , as sufficient information is known about these substances that they are considered to cause minimum risk because of their intrinsic properties ;
i thank him again for giving such a clear answer .
the financial regulation obliges the commission to issue an open call for tenders where the four-year amount is in excess of around eur 155 000 .
the successful candidates were then allowed to compete and , finally , contractors for different lots were then chosen on the basis of cost and quantity .
the safety data sheet shall be supplied in an official language of the member state ( s ) where the substance or preparation is placed on the market , unless the member state ( s ) concerned provide otherwise .
those participants that do not carry out the study themselves shall have the right to receive the full study report within two weeks following payment to the participant that carried out the study .
authorisation requirement
the agency shall notify the competent authority of the relevant member state that the information is available on its database .
the result of the completeness check ; and
i fully agree with what my fellow members have already said , that we should , right now , devote special attention to the meaning of democracy and to the rights of us all , starting with the rights of those teachers .
the draft opinion shall be deemed to have been received seven days after the agency has sent it .
the registration fee shall not be reimbursed in such cases .
if the teachers were rehired , language courses would continue to be delivered by internal teachers and teachers employed at the language schools .
the difference in salary and other conditions was significant .
experience shows that internal teachers were not particularly flexible vis-à-vis the commission , despite the advantageous conditions it offered .
we therefore withdraw our signature and , even though we agree with the text , we shall be voting against it .
&apos; calls on the eu and the member states to fully deliver their pledges of at least eur 1.5 billion announced by commissioner barroso in jakarta and to do so in full in the form of a donation . &apos;
this will be done .
in 2004 the british council tendered for english courses , but the contracts were awarded to cll and lerian communications .
the registration waiting period in accordance with article 21 ( 1 ) for the new registrant shall be extended by a period of four months , if the previous registrant so requests .
of course i disagree with these practices .
- mr president , i wish to announce that we are withdrawing our signature from this proposal because the european parliament has once again been used to attack the italian government .
after &apos; believes that &apos; , i would like to insert &apos; for industrialised countries &apos; and then continue with &apos; medium term reductions of the order &apos; and so on .
application of downstream user obligations
the second thing i have to say is that what the commission has done here is inexcusable .
when any updated information is submitted in accordance with this paragraph , any decision to amend or withdraw the authorisation in the context of the review shall be taken in accordance with the procedure referred to in article 64 applied mutatis mutandis .
enlargement has brought about an increase in the number of member states , so i cannot believe that there is suddenly no need for these teachers .
let me call my principal witness , vice-president loyola de palacio , and quote what she wrote to her fellow vice-president neil kinnock on 29 june 2004 :
so listen to the social arguments and the cultural arguments , commissioner , and take another look at those documents which have been written for you by your high-level officials .
multilingualism is a jewel which must be maintained , and it is not the case nor has it been proven that all needs can be covered by means of external sources ; and it is not the case , commissioner , that quality is equivalent , because all the analyses have been carried out on the basis of differing elements , comparing situations and languages which are not equal .
the agency shall keep an up-to-date list of experts .
the signs are there already in the structures and relations concerning translations , and these are the results .
discharges of a substance from a point source governed by the requirement for prior regulation referred to in article 11 ( 3 ) ( g ) of directive 2000 / 60 / ec and legislation adopted under article 16 of that directive .
the management board shall adopt rules of procedure for voting , including the conditions for a member to vote on behalf of another member .
on agreement on the sharing of the information , the previous registrant shall make available to the new registrant the agreed information and shall give the new registrant the permission to refer to the previous registrant &apos;s full study report .
we are not in court here , mr potočnik ; we are in the european parliament .
establishing and maintaining a regular dialogue with the european parliament ;
this is no way to solve financial problems that may arise in any of these situations .
this time , also very much due to the efforts of its citizens , europe lived up to what its stature should be .
the decision shall be taken in accordance with the procedure laid down in articles 50 and 52 .
capitalism is preparing to re-build the interests of the multinationals on top of the graves , to turn the human tragedy into contracts and stock exchange indicators , to turn any &apos; humanitarian aid &apos; into interventions by the imperialist centres .
the money raised as a result of grass-roots solidarity must not be embezzled .
.- we stand with respect before the pain for the thousands of dead , missing and homeless .
the disaster mainly hit the grass-roots classes .
the commission may , after consulting with the agency , take a decision to vary the percentage of dossiers selected and amend or include further criteria in paragraph 5 in accordance with the procedure referred to in article 133 ( 4 ) .
we have our differences , but we are united by the same core values .
new knowledge of the risks of the substance to human health and / or the environment of which he may reasonably be expected to have become aware which leads to changes in the safety data sheet or the chemical safety report ;
accordingly , it is crucial that we make the most of president bush &apos;s next visit to restore transatlantic relations in full and without any grudges .
in respect of its staff , the agency shall exercise the powers which have been devolved to the appointing authority .
i therefore vehemently oppose those who try to turn allies into opponents or rivals .
more than a mere historical curiosity , this relationship is crucial and indispensable , given the challenges and opportunities facing us .
members of the management board may not be members of the forum .
the duration of the time-limited review for any authorisation shall be determined on a case-by-case basis taking into account all relevant information including the elements listed in paragraph 4 ( a ) to ( d ) , as appropriate .
whilst the situation in iraq remains tense and dangerous , it has improved .
in the middle east , following the elections to the palestinian authority , we have the chance to be on the same side .
progress in these issues could lead to effective joint action by the two sides of the atlantic .
members of the board of appeal may not take part in any appeal proceedings if they have any personal interest therein , or if they have previously been involved as representatives of one of the parties to the proceedings , or if they participated in the decision under appeal .
a multiannual work programme , which shall be regularly revised .
i therefore urge the eu to make use of all the resources at its disposal to enable prompt and rapid action to protect young victims .
in order to avoid animal testing , testing on vertebrate animals for the purposes of this regulation shall be undertaken only as a last resort .
all that remains is for me to express my sincerest appreciation of all citizens and governments who have , so generously and spontaneously , contributed towards financing humanitarian actions to help the devastated peoples .
i welcome the efforts successfully made by the commission and the council , and i hope that europe will very quickly have available to it helmets painted with the blue of the european flag and signalling emergency aid .
mr president , i should like to express , over and above the shock we all felt confronted with the huge suffering caused in the indian ocean by the disastrous tidal wave experienced at the end of last year , the unease we felt at seeing the development of a diplomacy of compassion that was naturally not devoid of ulterior motives on the part of the nations concerned .
last november in my explanation of vote on the eu &apos;s strategy for the buenos aires conference on climate change - cop-10 - i wrote that i felt it was important for &quot; the eu delegation to the buenos aires conference ( ... ) to take a leading role in negotiations .
the agency shall make further recommendations at least every second year with a view to including further substances in annex xiv .
accidental release measures ;
the agency shall make available on its web-site broad information on uses , taking into account articles 118 and 119 on access to information , for which applications have been received and for reviews of authorisations , with a deadline by which information on alternative substances or technologies may be submitted by interested third parties .
the identity of the substance as specified in section 2 of annex vi ;
the large gap between cost and benefit involved in such study must always be borne in mind , however .
we do not believe that the european parliament should call upon those countries that have still not ratified the kyoto protocol to do so .
notifiers and registrants of differing entries for a single substance come to an agreed entry in accordance with paragraph 2 .
available information on the risks to human health or the environment of any alternative substances or technologies .
there has been a spate of warnings throughout the world about climate change , for which responsibility undeniably rests with an economic system that does not respect the balance in the relationship between human beings and nature and in the activity that arises from that system .
applications may be made for one or several substances , that meet the definition of a group of substances in section 1.5 of annex xi , and for one or several uses .
climate change is a consequence and an illustration of the unsustainable nature of the capitalist system of production , with its unchecked plundering of natural resources and its complete subservience to short-term gain , instead of investment in long-term planning that encompasses the preservation of the conditions needed for the human race to survive .
the required response should not be guided by the laws of the system that gave rise to the problem .
managing all the agency resources necessary for carrying out its tasks ;
any such decision shall take into account the socio-economic impact of the restriction , including the availability of alternatives .
faced with this disaster , we are thinking firstly of the pain and suffering of the victims &quot; families .
the agency shall publish without delay the intention of the commission or of a member state to instigate a restriction procedure for a substance and shall inform those who submitted a registration for that substance .
the resources must be found within the existing framework for the eu &apos;s total budget .
necessary resources must be prioritised , at both national and international levels , to help people in need and to support the reconstruction work .
the executive director shall decide whether to agree to such requests .
the management board shall deliver an opinion on the agency &apos;s final accounts .
emissions of a substance from an installation for which a permit was granted in accordance with directive 96 / 61 / ec ; or
i visited aceh and the city of banda aceh six months ago .
the management board shall adopt the practical arrangements for implementing regulation ( ec ) no 1049 / 2001 , including appeals or remedies necessary for reviewing a partial or full rejection of a confidentiality request , by 1 june 2008 .
this process should give priority to the meeting of human needs and the fulfilment of basic human rights .
it is true that , in principle , its approach is the same for all countries .
the recent dramatic events in ukraine have reconfirmed that country &apos;s place on the european map .
each registrant shall subsequently submit separately the information specified in article 10 ( a ) ( i ) , ( ii ) , ( iii ) and ( x ) , and any relevant indication under article 10 ( a ) ( viii ) .
i have received , at the close of this debate , six motions for resolutions in accordance with rule 103 of the rules of procedure . ( 1 )
dossiers
we have no doubt that these events will go down in history as a milestone not only for ukraine but also for the eu &apos;s relations with that country .
&apos; we denounce the flagrant lack of openness on the part of the commission , who waited until today to announce the breaking of the teachers &apos; contracts .
one set of papers from mid-2003 actually dismisses rumours of planned restructuring .
substances identified under article 57 ( f ) having persistent , bioaccumulative and toxic properties or very persistent and very bioaccumulative properties .
documents from throughout 2003 and the first half of 2004 show that at a whole series of meetings the teachers were given the impression that everything was fine , it was business as usual .
it was placed on the market in the community , or in the countries acceding to the european union on 1 january 1995 or on 1 may 2004 , before entry into force of this regulation by the manufacturer or importer and was considered as having been notified in accordance with the first indent of article 8 ( 1 ) of directive 67 / 548 / eec but does not meet the definition of a polymer as set out in this regulation , provided the manufacturer or importer has documentary evidence of this ;
such access rights shall be granted on a royalty-free basis .
a commission official said something telling to us when we questioned her on this in committee .
title xiii competent authorities
however , it is never too late .
identified use : means a use of a substance on its own or in a preparation , or a use of a preparation , that is intended by an actor in the supply chain , including his own use , or that is made known to him in writing by an immediate downstream user ;
the commission has behaved in a disgraceful manner .
i understand that a meeting will take place tomorrow between the commission and the unions in brussels .
in such cases , the producer or importer shall supply appropriate instructions to the recipient of the article .
this decision has been perceived by certain parties as &apos; untransparent &apos; and &apos; unjustified &apos; .
in this respect the questions put by the chairman of the committee on employment and social affairs reflect the concerns expressed by the teachers themselves .
in the case of actions for the benefit of specific groups , article 39 ( 1 ) and article 40 ( 1 ) shall not apply .
any manufacturer of an on-site isolated intermediate in quantities of one tonne or more per year shall submit a registration to the agency for the on-site isolated intermediate .
that would have resulted in compensation equivalent to between 12 and 19 months &apos; salary .
the agency &apos;s committees for risk assessment and socio-economic analysis shall give their draft opinions within ten months of the date of receipt of the application .
each sief shall be operational until 1 june 2018 .
mr president , commissioner rehn stated recently in a article that the eu cannot close its doors to future enlargement , which is extended to all european countries with a european vocation and common democratic values .
this could be a useful way of showing brussels that ukraine really is now independent from moscow and seriously wants to do business in the international arena .
the competent authority ( for decisions taken under article 46 ) and the agency ( for decisions taken under articles 40 and 41 ) shall take any comments received into account and may amend the draft decision accordingly .
i would also recommend the oecd to ukraine , but full oecd membership requires wto membership first , one of the new government &apos;s pressing goals .
if the member state committee fails to reach a unanimous agreement , the agency shall submit the conflicting opinions to the commission , which shall decide which authority shall be the competent authority , in accordance with the procedure referred to in article 133 ( 3 ) , and the member states concerned shall adopt substances for evaluation accordingly .
the eu must focus on the practical questions holding ukraine back : corruption , low administrative capacity , crony capitalism , freedom of the press .
solutions do not just require money , but also thousands of experts from the new eu member states , which have faced the same problems and have resolved them successfully ; their membership of the eu is proof of that .
if the manufacturer has production sites in more than one member state , the relevant member state shall be the one in which the head office of the manufacturer is established .
it is clear that there was an essential integrity to this election that was lacking in the earlier one .
finally , preparations must be made for talks on an association agreement , as the recent enlargement taught us that this is the right instrument to use in order to achieve stabilisation and open the doors to future membership .
the margin of victory was of an order of magnitude greater than any possible margin of fraud .
in its review decision the commission may , if circumstances have changed and taking into account the principle of proportionality , amend or withdraw the authorisation , if under the changed circumstances it would not have been granted or if suitable alternatives in accordance with article 60 ( 5 ) become available .
a final decision shall be taken in accordance with the procedure referred to in article 133 ( 4 ) .
implementing this policy with ukraine - the eu-ukraine action plan - would send a strong message that the eu places great importance on the relationship and acknowledges kiev &apos;s european orientation .
with regard to the action plan , let me stress the importance of making full use of the action plan , thus enhancing the eu &apos;s relationship with ukraine .
when assessing whether suitable alternative substances or technologies are available , all relevant aspects shall be taken into account by the commission , including :
first , i will say a few words about what the european neighbourhood policy entails and , after that , i will provide clarification on the action plan , that is to say , i will look at its substance and how to proceed with it .
that being said , i would point out that the commission should also be an attractive place of work and should also comply with the current ground rules designed to protect employees .
the commission too must demonstrate social responsibility and sound management .
if the agency does not receive or make any comments , it shall include this substance on the list referred to in paragraph 1 .
the matter has been discussed several times in that committee , but it has in actual fact also been discussed in the committee on budgets in which we perhaps had to approach it at a rather more difficult angle , given that we also , of course , wanted to see administration that was as efficient and inexpensive as possible .
the administration must of course be efficient and inexpensive and , in recent years , we in parliament have exerted considerable pressure to ensure that the commission implements reforms and that , through these reforms , a more open and transparent system is obtained , which also means a system that is perhaps better in tune with the world around us .
where most of them were concerned , a delay of five , six or ten years would have been in order .
the agency shall refer the matter to the member state committee , in order to agree which authority shall be the competent authority , taking into account the member state in which the manufacturer ( s ) or importer ( s ) is located , the respective proportions of total community gross domestic product , the number of substances already being evaluated by a member state and the expertise available .
on 30 june last year , the chairman of my group , mr wurtz , sent letters to the presidents of the commission and parliament , saying that the brutal decision to dismiss 43 language teachers at the commission with open-ended contracts was in breach of the commitments undertaken by the commission , the council and parliament in the trialogue of 18 march 1997 .
the members of each committee appointed following nomination by a member state shall ensure that there is appropriate coordination between the tasks of the agency and the work of their member state competent authority .
ways should also , however , be looked into of ensuring , in the future , proper administration that complies with the requirements of the law , is inexpensive and is suitably in keeping with the organisation &apos;s social responsibility .
i cannot believe for one single moment that the commission might be compared to what are known pejoratively in france as the bosses .
rather , this is a genuine labour dispute .
the name of the substance as specified in section 2 of annex vi , including its einecs and cas number or , if not available , any other identity codes ;
the committee for socio-economic analysis may , if it deems it necessary , require the applicant or request third parties to submit , within a specified time period , additional information on possible alternative substances or technologies .
the agency shall invite all interested parties to submit comments within three months of the date of publication , in particular on uses which should be exempt from the authorisation requirement .
if the holder cannot demonstrate that the risk is adequately controlled , he shall also submit an update of the socio-economic analysis contained in the original application .
how has the restricted invitation to tender been organised for the purpose of selecting the firms invited to replace the former teachers no later than february 2005 ?
mr president , i too was dissatisfied with the commission &apos;s reply .
i would also point out that we miss no opportunity in this house to denounce the externalisation or privatisation of services that is undertaken by national or international companies in our member states .
our institutions too engage in privatisation and externalisation , but without putting in place the social plans such as we - at least in my own country - impose upon our companies following negotiation with the unions .
whether the transfer to alternatives would result in reduced overall risks to human health and the environment , taking into account the appropriateness and effectiveness of risk management measures ;
where the person concerned fails to fulfil his duties , the executive director has the right to terminate or suspend the contract or withhold remuneration .
the commission shall be responsible for taking decisions on applications for authorisations in accordance with this title .
as a first step the parties agreed to launch a call for tenders for the supply of language courses , and also , by way of derogation from this principle , to allow existing internal teachers to continue their activities within their existing contract framework .
in the mid 1990s , the committee on budgets criticised both the commission and the council for the costs associated with this practice .
the commission opted , however , to calculate the compensation on the basis of the maximum amount ever granted by belgian courts .
the fourth question is : does the commission consider that its handling of this matter stands as a good example of best practice in terms of prior consultation and the provision of information in good time ?
if the owner of a study as referred to in paragraph 1 which involves testing on vertebrate animals refuses to provide either proof of the cost of that study or the study itself to ( an ) other participant ( s ) , he shall not be able to proceed with registration until he provides the information to the other participants ( s ) .
under the social dialogue agreement , staff representatives and the local personnel committee represent persons employed under the staff regulations .
the commission informed the teachers &apos; representatives , together with the teachers concerned , at the general assembly held on 18 june 2004 , before the decision was notified .
secondly , the commission accepts that it could have informed the trialogue co-signatories - the committee on budgets and the council - of its intention to proceed with the second phase of externalisation .
where information on intrinsic properties of a substance has been generated by reference to structurally related substance ( s ) , the evaluation may also cover these related substances .
there are three elements that need to be considered here .
the precise tonnage of the substance or preparation manufactured or placed on the market ;
after that basic introduction , i will now turn to the specific questions asked .
the dossier contains information in article 10 ( a ) ( iv ) , ( vi ) and / or ( vii ) submitted separately as per article 11 ( 3 ) ; or
it was no longer tenable to continue a dual system where half of the courses were provided by internal teachers at a cost approximately four times greater than the courses provided by language schools , with no difference in quality .
the agency shall be responsible for coordinating the substance evaluation process and ensuring that substances on the community rolling action plan are evaluated .
the second thing i want to say is that i do not think it acceptable that the commission , which is , after all , engaged alongside us in the fight for a social europe , should ditch its social responsibility and its obligations as an employer when it comes to safeguarding its own interests .
members of the board may be objected to by any party to the appeal proceedings on any of the grounds mentioned in paragraph 5 , or if suspected of partiality .
the agency or member states shall refer to any dossier , chemical safety report or risk assessment submitted to the agency or member state under this regulation .
was the teachers &quot; lawyer consulted in due time , for example ?
the employer did nothing to discharge its obligations .
is the commission even acquainted with the precise terms of its own communication on corporate social responsibility ?
on behalf of the group of the european people &apos;s party ( christian democrats ) and european democrats , and following discussions with the persons concerned , i will ask , as i have done before , what alternative employment there actually was for these teachers in view of the fact that the deadlines for appointments to other institutions had already expired at the end of june .
whenever a decision is taken to include in annex xiv substances referred to in article 57 , such a decision shall be taken in accordance with the procedure referred to in article 133 ( 4 ) .
the committees and the forum may , if they consider it appropriate , seek advice on important questions of a general scientific or ethical nature from appropriate sources of expertise .
where a substance has previously been registered less than 12 years earlier as referred to in article 26 ( 3 ) , the potential registrant :
the persistence of poverty and the exploitation of people give rise to extreme disquiet .
these rules shall in particular lay down the procedures for appointing and replacing the chairman , replacing members and the procedures for delegating certain tasks to working groups .
the next item is the debate on six motions for resolutions on the trafficking of women and children in cambodia ( 3 ) .
if , within 30 days of the referral , the member state committee reaches a unanimous agreement on the identification , the agency shall include the substance in the list referred to in paragraph 1 .
sharing of data involving tests
once a restriction has been imposed .
meetings of the management board
the agency shall publish the draft opinion on its website without delay .
finally , i would like to recall that following the positive developments on the nuclear front , the european union is currently in the process of resuming talks with the iranian government on trade , investment and economic issues .
that is quite remarkable in a country which previously had remained closed to united nations visits for 16 years .
we are all , therefore , very sensitive to this issue .
that is why the european union has decided unanimously to co-sponsor the resolution on the situation of human rights in iran adopted at the united nations general assembly of november 2004 .
like the council , which adopted conclusions on this issue at the end of 2004 , the commission is of the opinion that little progress has been made in the past two years , despite the commitment made by the government of iran to strengthen respect for human rights and promote the rule of law .
mr president , the european commission shares parliament &apos;s concern at the human rights situation in iran and the recent testimonies of torture .
where the analysis referred to in point ( e ) shows that suitable alternatives are available , taking into account the elements in article 60 ( 5 ) , a substitution plan including a timetable for proposed actions by the applicant .
we all hope that iran , a country with plenty of potential and in great cultural turmoil , can become a fully operative economic and political partner as soon as possible .
if the conditions laid down in article 68 are fulfilled , the commission shall prepare a draft amendment to annex xvii , within three months of receipt of the opinion of the committee for socio-economic analysis or by the end of the deadline established under article 71 if that committee does not form an opinion , whichever is the earlier .
this is a particularly positive development in the continuing paris agreement of november 2004 between france , germany and great britain , on behalf of the european union , and iran on the moratorium on uranium enrichment and control of iranian activities in the nuclear sector .
authorisations may be reviewed at any time if :
the εu is iran &apos;s first trading partner , a fact which proves the importance of reinforcing euro-iranian relations as a tool in the european strategy for the democratisation of iran , for respect of its international obligations and for reversing its internalisation and isolation .
within this framework , the european parliament must take specific initiatives .
when we maintain diplomatic relations with this regime , and especially when the council labels the main opposition as terrorists , we are encouraging the regime to carry on its violations of human rights more than before .
the agency shall undertake a completeness check according to article 20 ( 2 ) first and second subparagraphs of each updated registration .
each member state may nominate candidates to membership of the committee for risk assessment .
however , we support it and , in particular , the paragraph on a review of the terrorist list by the public affairs committee and the foreign affairs committee .
when a request for information has been made according to paragraph 1 , the potential and the previous registrant ( s ) as referred to in paragraph 1 shall make every effort to reach an agreement on the sharing of the information requested by the potential registrant ( s ) with respect to article 10 ( a ) ( vi ) and ( vii ) .
specific provisions for phase-in substances
we must start by discharging our own responsibilities in europe and then press home the point to our cambodian partners that this is a fundamental human rights issue and one on which we will yield not an inch , and we must be willing not only to give them massive support in building up their justice system , but also , within the eu , to clean our own house .
there is , on the one hand , the cambodian government itself , which must , at long last , ratify and implement the relevant un convention and the relevant agreement on the combating , firstly of trafficking in human beings , and secondly of organised crime .
a use shall not be authorised if this would constitute a relaxation of a restriction set out in annex xvii .
identification of substances referred to in article 57
his name and address and the name of the contact person and , where appropriate , the name and address of the person representing him in accordance with article 4 as specified in section 1 of annex vi ;
in addition , it is of the utmost importance for support to be given to those ngos and people who are involved in the fight against the abuse of women and children .
it is the eu &apos;s moral duty to deploy all the leverage at its disposal in order to change this situation .
this is something we have to denounce ; this is where we really have to point out where the problem lies and at last bring the necessary pressure to bear on the cambodian government , so that nothing like what has happened there can ever happen again .
we must also , though , ask ourselves questions about what lies behind this trade .
to ensure transparency , the management board shall , on the basis of a proposal by the executive director and in agreement with the commission , adopt rules to ensure the availability to the public of regulatory , scientific or technical information concerning the safety of substances on their own , in preparations or in articles which is not of a confidential nature .
subject to paragraph 6 , after inclusion of a substance in annex xiv , this substance shall not be subjected to new restrictions under the procedure outlined in title viii covering the risks to human health or the environment from the use of the substance on its own , in a preparation or incorporation of a substance in an article arising from the intrinsic properties specified in annex xiv .
mr president , we are all agreed that trafficking in women and children is a crime ; this case in cambodia is , alas , but one among many , and there are a great many such cases around the world that are not known about .
the members of the board of appeal may not be removed either from office or from the list during their respective terms , unless there are serious grounds for such removal and the commission , after obtaining the opinion of the management board , takes a decision to this effect .
traffickers quite often receive assistance from immigration officials .
it is also estimated that the judiciary fails to convict in 94 % of the cases brought to court .
an appeal may be brought , in accordance with articles 91 , 92 and 93 , against agency decisions under paragraphs 2 or 3 of this article .
within 12 months of the receipt of the request from the commission in paragraph 1 and if this dossier demonstrates that action on a community-wide basis is necessary , beyond any measures already in place , the agency shall suggest restrictions , in order to initiate the restrictions process .
this process involves threats and often violence against the activists who carry out this work .
according to our information , the next day the criminals were freed without charge and the same type of activity continued to operate in the hotel .
adoption of decisions under dossier evaluation
it is unimaginable , but it was real .
ladies and gentlemen , we have the obligation to work every day , not just when the fascination of round figures , 60 years , - why 60 and not 59 ? - revives the memory , but every day , so that the values of our constitution - peace , human rights , respect and tolerance - which are entirely contrary to what happened in auschwitz , are spread and defended in schools , at work , on the stairs , in the street , in the bars , in everybody &apos;s shared daily lives .
today , 60 years later , we must continue to fight everything that made it possible : racism , anti-semitism , xenophobia , interracial hate , the indifference of our society , which believes that it has nothing to do with it , until it finally realises that it does , that it also affects it , but by then it is too late .
if the concerned registrant ( s ) or downstream user ( s ) wish to comment , they shall provide their comments to the agency .
they have now arrived , and i would like to assure our two guests that we will not cease from the fight for human rights in russia , chechnya and throughout the world .
committee for risk assessment : an assessment of the risk to human health and / or the environment arising from the use ( s ) of the substance , including the appropriateness and effectiveness of the risk management measures as described in the application and , if relevant , an assessment of the risks arising from possible alternatives ;
mr president , i believe that what we have voted on , and regrettably has been rejected , is the paragraph amended by mrs prets ; it is not the amendment , but the paragraph as amended .
it shall make the information identified in article 119 ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) in the database ( s ) publicly available , free of charge , over the internet , except where a request made under article 10 ( a ) ( xi ) is considered justified .
he shall also send this reply to the management board .
the commission &apos;s cooperation activities in cambodia are directed ultimately at reducing poverty but are also designed to reflect the eu &apos;s commitment to human rights and democracy , including equal treatment for men and women and the protection of children .
physical and chemical properties ;
it will improve the protection of , and raise awareness about , the situation of those who work , at personal risk , to advance human rights through non-violent means , taking into account the recommendations of paragraph 13 of the european union guidelines on human rights defenders .
the downstream user implements or recommends an exposure scenario which includes as a minimum the conditions described in the exposure scenario communicated to him in the safety data sheet ;
liability of the agency
the royal government of cambodia has recently taken a number of positive initiatives to address the problem , including the signature of memoranda of understanding with thailand on trafficking in women and children and on the management of migrant labour between the two countries , participation in the coordinated mekong ministerial initiative against trafficking and the establishment of a department of anti-human trafficking in the ministry of interior in 2002 .
the member state embassies in phnom penh and the ec delegation joined other donors in a further statement to welcome this announcement and to express the hope that the conclusions of the inquiry would be credible and transparent .
over 60 % of women and young girls are forced into prostitution , and the majority of them are either infected with hiv or suffering from aids .
information in the supply chain
aim of authorisation and considerations for substitution
another cause is illiteracy and the communist ideology of the khmer rouge , who attempted to build a new society by means of terror , threats and lies , claiming over a million victims in the process .
this title shall not otherwise affect the competences vested in the european food safety authority .
summaries of the commission decisions , including the authorisation number and the reasons for the decision , in particular where suitable alternatives exist , shall be published in the official journal of the european union and shall be made publicly available in a database established and kept up to date by the agency .
mr president , the commission resolutely condemns all forms of trafficking in human beings and sexual exploitation , especially of children .
substances meeting the criteria for classification as carcinogenic category 1 or 2 in accordance with directive 67 / 548 / eec ;
it took a very long time for my country , austria , to admit its shared responsibility for the crimes of national socialism .
mr president , mr schulz has said that we must weigh every word today to ensure that it does justice to the victims and to the perpetrators &quot; responsibility .
with respect , the confusion has arisen not least owing to the services , which have put it all on the same line : recital a , oral amendment from the ppe-de group , and the amendment from the uen group , about which mr schulz spoke .
the number of substances included in annex xiv and the dates specified under paragraph 1 shall also take account of the agency &apos;s capacity to handle applications in the time provided for .
which information requirements would require other new studies to be carried out by him .
two separate votes are required here .
registrants are only required to share in the costs of information that they are required to submit to satisfy their registration requirements .
there are two separate amendments here .
the procedure set out in paragraphs 2 to 10 of this article shall apply for the purpose of identifying substances meeting the criteria referred to in article 57 and establishing a candidate list for eventual inclusion in annex xiv .
any natural or legal person may appeal against a decision addressed to that person , or against a decision which , although addressed to another person , is of direct and individual concern to the former .
the second point i should like to make is as follows ; we acknowledge that the two largest groups in this house - and rightly so - wish to reach a broad consensus on this issue , and this is why we are able to join this consensus .
mr president , mr schulz is right ; all our words and all their consequences are of enormous importance .
so please now present your oral amendment to paragraph 5 , indent 2 .
he should be speaking on paragraph 5 , indent 2 , which is the wording in polish of the auschwitz-birkenau museum .
mr sonik , there has been some confusion .
paragraph 15 is inappropriate in this context .
the first part of our amendment would become an addition , while the second part would be the subject of a separate vote .
procedure and time periods for examination of testing proposals
any request for further information and deadline set in accordance with the third subparagraph of paragraph 2 .
studies involving vertebrate animals shall not be repeated .
it is an anti-imperialist fight .
providing technical and scientific guidance on the operation of this regulation for member state competent authorities and providing support to the helpdesks established by member states under title xiii ;
they are fighting so that the peoples themselves can determine their future and exploit the resources for common progress and advance .
one must bear in mind that the countries in need of help must be subject to close scrutiny , in terms both of enhancing the processes towards democratic consolidation , and of progress in respecting human rights .
the qualifications required for the members of the board of appeal shall be determined by the commission in accordance with the procedure referred to in article 133 ( 3 ) .
.- the foreign debt of the poor , developing countries comes from loans imposed with particularly unfavourable , predatory terms by international imperialist organisations , especially the world bank and the imf .
the draft opinions shall include the following elements :
in this respect , i had the opportunity , along with other members of this house , to write to the president of parliament to notify him of this wish and to request that the ukrainian president-elect address this house soon .
i believe that the firmness shown by the eu in defence of democracy and freedom should not be misinterpreted , nor used to antagonise a neighbour of its importance .
distributors shall pass on such information to the next actor or distributor up the supply chain .
until 1 june 2013 , a member state may maintain any existing and more stringent restrictions in relation to annex xvii on the manufacture , placing on the market or use of a substance , provided that those restrictions have been notified according to the treaty .
at the same time , i feel that , if that is the ukrainians &quot; freely expressed desire , then we must pave the way for them to be able to come and join the eu .
the first is the capacity of the majority of the ukrainian people to fight for democracy , for freedom and for a social model that is essentially identical to that of the eu .
he has been the head of a body that is solid , determined and united behind a single idea .
this may be facilitated by following any cost sharing guidance which is based on those principles and is adopted by the agency in accordance with article 77 ( 2 ) ( g ) .
the executive director shall perform the duties of authorising officer and shall implement the agency &apos;s budget .
the fact that we do not always agree should be a catalyst for promoting dialogue and not an excuse to foment sterile and counter-productive tensions , which are of use only to those who have always wanted to see us divided .
if the dossier does not conform , the reasons shall be given to the agency or the member state in writing within 45 days of receipt .
the date ( s ) from which the placing on the market and the use of the substance shall be prohibited unless an authorisation is granted ( hereinafter referred to as the sunset date ) which should take into account , where appropriate , the production cycle specified for that use ;
a safety data sheet is not required to be communicated with the substance or preparation in accordance with article 31 ;
cancellation of 80 % of iraqi debt is certainly something to be welcomed .
we also note that money immediately loaned by the eu must be written off and that it must thus be entered in the accounts as an item of budgetary expenditure .
. the policy of community cooperation must favour economic and social growth in developing countries , and the gradual integration of those countries into the world &apos;s economy .
where the agency identifies a potential source of conflict , it shall contact the body concerned in order to ensure that any relevant scientific or technical information is shared and to identify the scientific or technical points which are potentially contentious .
if a registration is incomplete , the agency shall inform the registrant , before expiry of the three-week or three-month period referred to in the second subparagraph , as to what further information is required in order for the registration to be complete , while setting a reasonable deadline for this .
the registration number ( s ) referred to in article 20 ( 3 ) , if available , for any substances for which information is communicated under points ( b ) , ( c ) or ( d ) of this paragraph ;
the death penalty , whether to be carried out immediately or delayed , has been used by the chinese state as a means of quashing the wishes of a large part of the population of tibet .
the identity of the substance ( s ) as specified in sections 2.1 to 2.3.4 of annex vi ;
we in this parliament , right across the political spectrum , have every reason to be indignant about the death penalty and certainly about its use as a political instrument , and we hope to prevent the execution in two weeks time of a respected and influential buddhist lama .
the agency shall submit the first draft rolling action plan to the member states by 1 december 2011 .
it is an area in the course of colonisation by the chinese and one where many newcomers fulfil the function of official , policeman or military .
we should be stressing to the chinese authorities that tenzin deleg rinpoche deserves a fair trial and not a sham trial .
the chinese authorities &quot; increasing interest in establishing good relations with european governments offers us a good opportunity to tackle the situation of tibet and to state once again , as we have done before , that it is necessary to find a fair and lasting response to tibetan demands .
i also believe this house should strongly support the continuation of the eu embargo on arms sales to the people &apos;s republic of china until such time as the human rights situation has improved and china has taken the vital step of signing the united nations covenant on civil and political rights .
this cannot be taken to mean , however , that china is entitled to declare tibet part of china , as tibet is most certainly not part of china .
in spite of this , the tibetan authorities and the dalai lama are prepared to hold a dialogue and would be satisfied with mere autonomy .
the term of office may be renewed once .
only then can we expect results .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , the citizens of the european union &apos;s new member states are well aware of what is meant by human rights violations , as such violations are still fresh in our memories .
the first report shall be published by 1 june 2012 .
the executive director shall , following approval by the management board , forward the agency &apos;s general report to the member states , the european parliament , the council , the commission , the european economic and social committee and the court of auditors , and shall have it published .
identification of the substance / preparation and of the company / undertaking ;
all such scientifically valid information and studies received shall be taken into account by the agency in preparing its decision in accordance with paragraph 3 .
we have never ceased from speaking out and winning support from parliaments and human rights organisations .
if a registrant has ceased the manufacture or import of the substance , or the production or import of an article , or the downstream user the use , he shall inform the agency of this fact with the consequence that the registered volume in his registration , if appropriate , shall be put to zero and no further information may be requested with respect to that substance , unless the registrant notifies the restart of the manufacture or import of the substance or the production or import of the article , or the downstream user notifies the restart of the use .
- mr president , 26 january will be the second anniversary of the execution of the monk lobsang dhondup .
for each case , rapporteurs and co-rapporteurs shall undertake to act in the interests of the community and shall make a declaration of commitment to fulfil their duties and a declaration of interests in writing .
the members of the committees shall be supported by the scientific and technical resources available to the member states .
it shall exercise disciplinary authority over the executive director .
we can assure them that we will continue to do everything possible to ensure that human rights prevail in russia and in chechnya .
mr president , as you were about to say , we now come to the matters of urgency and the human rights issues .
ladies and gentlemen , yesterday i represented the president at the meeting of ambassadors from the asean countries , who attended the debate we held in this house on the tsunami .
any updates following registration shall include the registration number .
since we last spoke about his case in this house , there have been rumours that his death sentence has been suspended and may be commuted to a life sentence .
we return today to his case .
bishop julius jia zhiguo , who belongs to the underground church , was recently arrested .
our demands are still on the agenda .
at the beginning of 2004 , the eu made an official démarche in beijing to request information on his whereabouts and state of health , expressed the hope that the death sentence would not be upheld and asked for judicial review of the case .
more recently , on 15 november , the eu troika made a new ad hoc démarche in beijing , during which the case of tenzin deleg rinpoche was again highlighted .
the eu is fully committed to urging china not to carry out the sentence and is prepared to contribute , in this respect , to finding an acceptable solution to the case under examination .
specific concentration limits , where applicable , resulting from the application of article 4 ( 4 ) of directive 67 / 548 / eec and articles 4 to 7 of directive 1999 / 45 / ec .
while reaffirming our longstanding position in favour of abolition , we have continued to press hard for at least the introduction of a moratorium .
to this end all manufacturers , importers and downstream users applying for authorisations shall analyse the availability of alternatives and consider their risks , and the technical and economic feasibility of substitution .
iran may well behave itself where nuclear energy is concerned , but this house , at any rate , will not reward it by turning a blind eye to what goes on there in the area of human rights , and i would also like to remind the commission and the council that any agreement has to be approved by this house .
handling and storage ;
we are also calling on our institutions to maintain the arms trade embargo against the people &apos;s republic of china , and not to lift it .
any supplier of an article containing a substance meeting the criteria in article 57 and identified in accordance with article 59 ( 1 ) in a concentration above 0,1 % weight by weight ( w / w ) shall provide the recipient of the article with sufficient information , available to the supplier , to allow safe use of the article including , as a minimum , the name of that substance .
- mr president , speaking on behalf of my group , i would like again to make it clear that , at the beginning of this twenty-first century , our constitution is an unequivocal expression of the importance to us of the rule of law and of the rights of citizens .
they matter to everyone throughout the world , and so our group emphatically reiterates its demand for the rule of law , and our demand that the chinese government promptly commute the death sentence passed on tenzin deleg rinpoche , and not only the sentence passed on him , but also the sentences passed on all those others in china upon whom the death penalty has been imposed .
these two things - as well as human rights - are important to us , and not to us alone .
participation of international organisations
require the registrant to submit further information directly related to the risk identified .
where , in accordance with article 77 , a committee is required to provide an opinion or consider whether a member state dossier conforms with the requirements of annex xv , it shall appoint one of its members as a rapporteur .
any change in the access granted to information in the registration .
the fees paid by undertakings ;
there are still serious problems where human rights are concerned , and every one of the european union &apos;s trade and cooperation agreements contains unequivocal statements on the human rights chapters on which cooperation depends .
sharia law continues to be imposed with its full rigour ; executions , stonings , torture and arbitrary arrests continue day by day .
stoning to death , amputation of limbs , floggings and torture are commonplace .
this is a fascist regime that has made a farce of democracy and has consigned human rights to the dustbin .
only today the nobel peace prize winner has been summoned to the office of the public prosecutor , which is an outrage .
making publicly available information as to which substances are being , and have been evaluated within 90 days of receipt of the information at the agency , in accordance with article 119 ( 1 ) ;
every five years , member states shall submit to the commission a report on the operation of this regulation in their respective territories , including sections on evaluation and enforcement as described in article 127 .
i hope you will write to the iranian ambassador and object to that .
i therefore call for the withdrawal of these proposals and for a unanimous vote in favour of the text as it is .
a justification for not considering risks to human health and the environment arising either from :
we must clearly express what we think joint cooperation means and stick to our principles , whilst also accepting that iran has its own structures and must itself decide in what way it is to change , difficult though this may often be for us to understand .
a member state may choose ( a ) substance ( s ) from the draft community rolling action plan , with the aim of becoming a competent authority for the purposes of articles 46 , 47 and 48 .
the agency &apos;s staff shall consist of officials assigned or seconded by the commission or member states on a temporary basis and of other servants recruited by the agency as necessary to carry out its tasks .
that means that minors aged 14 and over can spend up to four years in what are called &quot; education camps , &quot; waiting to be executed , instead of being able to have a proper education and a future to look forward to .
i do not see last december &apos;s united nations resolution as an interruption to this dialogue , but rather as a component of our policy and an admonition to us .
when granting the authorisation , and in any conditions imposed therein , the commission shall take into account all discharges , emissions and losses , including risks arising from diffuse or dispersive uses , known at the time of the decision .
we are evidently being listened to after all , and can hope that our intervention in the human rights sphere can meet with success .
mr president , commissioner , the european union and iran have returned to the negotiating table in order to resume talks on a joint trade and cooperation agreement .
performing the tasks allotted to it under title iii ;
composition of each substance
if it is not technically possible or if it does not appear scientifically necessary to give information on one or more of the items below , the reasons shall be clearly stated .
i would like to draw the parliament &apos;s attention to a rather unsettling development in romania .
after all , we cannot have more europe for less money , and richer countries cannot change policies following the admission of poorer ones , when they had previously promised them substantial resources .
the authorities are quite indifferent to this .
mr president , euthanasia was first legalised in the netherlands , and sick newborn babies are being killed there completely irresponsibly .
other means of identification available may also be indicated .
to this end , i have held talks with the president-in-office of the council , mr juncker , and i have kept the conference of presidents constantly informed about the progress of those talks , and i can tell you that following the exchange of letters that took place last week , and having heard the opinion of the political groups and also speaking by telephone with the president of the commission , mr barroso , i can tell you that the president of the european parliament , on behalf of this institution of course , will participate in the meeting which the 25 heads of state or government will hold tomorrow with mr bush in brussels .
the visit by president bush this week is being presented as a meeting with the european institutions .
an assessment factor of 1000 is typically applied to the lowest of three short term l ( e ) c50 values derived from species representing different trophic levels and a factor of 10 to the lowest of three long-term noec values derived from species representing different trophic levels .
this annex sets out the requirements for a safety data sheet that is provided for a substance or a preparation in accordance with article 31 .
the turnout was slightly less than that for the last european elections in spain and also very close to the average across all 25 countries of the union .
in particular , the exposure estimation shall take account of :
the chemical safety assessment shall be based on a comparison of the potential adverse effects of a substance with the known or reasonably foreseeable exposure of man and / or the environment to that substance taking into account implemented and recommended risk management measures and operational conditions .
mr president , with a heart and a half i forgive you !
please understand that there was great confusion in the chamber at that point and i did not see you .
list those conditions such as temperature , pressure , light , shock , etc . , which may cause a dangerous reaction and if possible give a brief description .
the disabled remain forgotten .
degradation half lives shall be quoted where available .
alright , we will deal with it within the item on the agenda which has already been included on the subject .
repeated dose toxicity
( title of exposure scenario 2 )
no amendment to the thursday sitting has been proposed .
i was somewhat surprised to have been given the floor , but i hope that i have been able to help resolve this minor problem .
description of the analytical methods or the appropriate bibliographical references for the identification of the substance and , where appropriate , for the identification of impurities and additives .
give the health , safety and environmental information shown on the label according to directives 67 / 548 / eec and 1999 / 45 / ec .
after all , we do not want to interfere in lebanon &apos;s affairs ; our aim is to ensure that the country is able to act entirely independently when taking decisions regarding its future .
regardless of the details of the process , tomorrow the three institutions will be present and i would like to make it very clear that the president-in-office of the council and the president of the commission have always agreed on the need for that to be the case .
the final version of the draft agenda for the present part-session as drawn up by the conference of presidents at its meeting of 17 february pursuant to rules 130 and 131 of the rules of procedure has been distributed .
information on manufacture and use ( s ) of the substance ( s )
member states shall appoint the competent authority or competent authorities responsible for performing the tasks allotted to competent authorities under this regulation and for cooperating with the commission and the agency in the implementation of this regulation .
fatty acids , c12-18 and c18-unsaturated
- mr president , a few days ago , the president of the greek parliament , addressing the new president of the hellenic republic , told him that , in the light of the referendum - in the light of the endorsement of the constitution - greece needed to restrict its national borders and its national sovereignty .
the murine local lymph node assay ( llna ) is the first-choice method for in vivo testing .
glucose c6h12o6
the first three steps shall be undertaken for every effect for which information is available and shall be recorded under the relevant section of the chemical safety report and where required and in accordance with article 31 , summarised in the safety data sheet under headings 2 and 11 .
parliament will give its opinion on these requests for urgent procedure tomorrow , tuesday , at the beginning of the sitting .
it is also coming to light that propaganda tricks were used during the campaign , for example that spanish citizens were told that a vote against the european constitution would be a vote against europe , which is a blatant lie .
question time with the council is scheduled for wednesday , and the council will naturally need to be present then .
you said that matters requiring the presence of the council must be completed by 6.00 p.m.
mr president , i am not sure whether i have misunderstood something .
this substance is identified by sda substance name : c12-c18 alkyl carboxylic acid and sda reporting no : 16-005-00 .
marine pollutant ,
the report referred to in article 117 ( 1 ) shall , in relation to enforcement , include the results of the official inspections , the monitoring carried out , the penalties provided for and the other measures taken pursuant to articles 125 and 126 during the previous reporting period .
the objective of the exposure assessment shall be to make a quantitative or qualitative estimate of the dose / concentration of the substance to which humans and the environment are or may be exposed .
less than 30 % , by mass , if assigned to un packaging group iii ( low hazard ) .
phase-in substances manufactured or imported in quantities of 1 to 10 tonnes and meeting the criteria in annex iii in accordance with article 12 ( 1 ) ( a ) and ( b ) ; and
directive as last amended by regulation ( ec ) no 1901 / 2006 .
i believe we should thank the spanish government , and everyone else involved , for having informed and engaged the public , and in particular for having involved civil society in the referendum campaign .
the greek people need to be told why , for the prosperity of europe , they need to be deprived of land and sovereignty .
the study need only be conducted if :
-mr president , parliament has consistently campaigned against illegal internment in guantanamo bay .
up to 30 000 lives were lost in the capital alone that day and the event signalled the decline of the city , which until then had been the fourth largest city in europe and one of the richest .
the risk characterisation shall consider the human populations ( exposed as workers , consumers or indirectly via the environment and if relevant a combination thereof ) and the environmental spheres for which exposure to the substance is known or reasonably foreseeable , under the assumption that the risk management measures described in the exposure scenarios in the section 5 have been implemented .
the human health hazard assessment shall consider the toxicokinetic profile ( i.e. absorption , metabolism , distribution and elimination ) of the substance and the following groups of effects , ( 1 ) acute effects ( acute toxicity , irritation and corrosivity ) , ( 2 ) sensitisation , ( 3 ) repeated dose toxicity and ( 4 ) cmr effects ( carcinogenity , mutagenicity and toxicity for reproduction ) .
this was obviously done with the collusion of the us government .
exposure scenario
therefore , a separate pbt and vpvb assessment is required .
i would like to take this opportunity to support the appeal of democratic circles on both sides of the border that we should move beyond this trauma from our semi-distant history , by telling the whole truth .
the information shown on the label shall be given under heading 15 .
there will also be quotas for players from the country in which the club is based , which are intended to promote national football .
safflower oil
it cannot be allowed to hide behind the vienna convention .
otherwise the pretensions of the eu to have a human rights policy ring hollow .
polish companies exporting meat and dairy products were also obliged to undergo special inspections by russian veterinary and plant health agencies .
toxicokinetics ( absorption , metabolism , distribution and elimination )
manufacture
this is proof that polish companies are being discriminated against on the russian market .
the study / ies do ( es ) not generally need to be conducted if :
it must instead sign a humanitarian agreement with farc in line with the geneva convention so that ingrid and 3 000 other prisoners can be released .
human exposure :
irritation
in view of the forthcoming anniversary of the end of the second world war , i should like to alert this house to fresh attempts that have been made to falsify and manipulate history for short-term political goals .
what the commissioner is proposing to us is that we rob peter to pay paul .
design of appropriate work processes and engineering controls , the use of adequate equipment and materials ,
evidence of this can be seen in recent statements made by the russian ministry of foreign affairs on the infamous yalta conference .
however , such further information does not need to be generated if the registrant implements or recommends sufficient risk management measures and operational conditions that enable derogation according to section 3 of annex xi from testing relevant for pbt and vpvb assessment .
the whole event showed me that there is a great interest in european cinema , in spite of the fact that our promotion of cinema production is weaker than that of american movies .
it was 23 february 2002 when ingrid betancourt , mouthpiece for my colombian sister party and a presidential candidate , was abducted while she was on the way to seek a negotiated solution to the conflict between the government and farc .
mr president , after so much consolidation and solidarity in relation to amendments , i will ask you to accept one very small oral amendment to the last line of recital a , concerning only two words .
the requests to manufacturers and importers to submit information to the commission made by a commission regulation in application of article 10 ( 2 ) of regulation ( eec ) no 793 / 93 , shall be considered as decisions adopted in accordance with article 52 of this regulation .
as i understand it , amendment 1 , by the uen group , just consists of the words &quot; the german &quot; instead of &quot; hitler &apos;s . &quot;
indeed , the accession of those countries entails a range of legal adaptations , in order that they can be placed on an equal footing in the areas of customs , the economy and competition .
the name in the iupac nomenclature for non-phase-in substances which are dangerous within the meaning of directive 67 / 548 / eec for a period of six years ;
mrs muscardini , at this point we are no longer debating the fundamental ideas .
the life-cycle stages resulting from the manufacture of the substance cover , where relevant , the waste stage .
it is obvious that there are some mental reservations and discrimination in this house .
mr cohn-bendit did not know what he was talking about , as he was referring to an amendment which had not been tabled .
however , you did not allow me to speak .
millions were deprived of all their rights , including their lives , for social reasons , the final solution with &quot; class enemies . &quot;
additional information may be necessary in some cases in view of the wide range of properties of the substances and preparations .
&quot; social classification &quot; is a very soft wording and i would ask you to support those two words on the grounds of history .
the purpose of the ongoing community project , as well as to facilitate user access to information , is to transform the content distribution sector and to reinvent the way in which companies , public bodies and governments interact with each other and with the general public .
digital content is most efficiently created and made accessible by the market or through decisions at member state level .
the june list is voting against increasing the appropriations with respect to the council &apos;s original proposal .
the accession of those countries in fact entails a range of legal adaptations , in order that they can be placed on an equal footing in the areas of customs , the economy and competition .

the june list believes that it is the united nations that has the main responsibility for mediating between its member states and for preventing conflicts or bringing them to an end .
what , finally , are missing are a condemnation of all terrorist acts , including suicide attacks carried out in the gaza strip , and an expression by the european parliament of its deep sympathy for the victims &quot; families .
in this new era that has just begun , it is also important that israel gives signs of hope , good will and cooperation , and pursues its justified and legitimate struggle against terrorism in compliance with the principles of international law .
this amounts to more than just speeches ; it is a conviction that has been constantly reaffirmed .
the signs are there : to begin with , the success of the palestinian elections , and then the coming to power of mahmoud abbas .
as a minimum , the potential effects to human health shall be assessed for the following physicochemical properties :
against this backdrop , the balance-sheet on the palestinian electoral process is in credit .

this is what the press in britain was writing yesterday .
mr president , i shall be brief .
a window of opportunity therefore exists in which the european union is committing itself more firmly than ever , as evidenced by this election observation mission , the largest ever delegated by the eu .
for each substance , the information given in this section shall be sufficient to enable each substance to be identified .
i also regret that the present resolution does not breathe a word about today &apos;s anti-semitic terrorism , about today &apos;s anti-semitic attacks , about the fact that today in our large cities , for example in antwerp , jewish people are being attacked by arabs and islamists who are today &apos;s anti-semites .
needless to say , i also regret that the appeal to curb the free expression of opinions was made , because democracy is not possible without it .
the use ( s ) of that substance on its own or in a preparation or the incorporation of the substance into an article for which the substance is placed on the market or for which he uses the substance himself has been exempted from the authorisation requirement in annex xiv itself in accordance with article 58 ( 2 ) ; or
a subsidy from the community , entered in the general budget of the european communities ( commission section ) ;
it also has more members than the eu and is , in that sense , more pan-european .
we cannot , and must not , forget this tragedy , which is one of the most shameful and painful chapters in our continent &apos;s history .
in the case of registrations of phase-in substances , such a registrant may continue the manufacture or import of the substance or production or import of an article , if there is no indication to the contrary from the agency in accordance with article 20 ( 2 ) within the three weeks after the submission date or , if submitted within the two-month period before the relevant deadline of article 23 , if there is no indication to the contrary from the agency in accordance with article 20 ( 2 ) within the three months from that deadline , without prejudice to article 27 ( 8 ) .
the supplier of a substance or a preparation shall provide the recipient of the substance or preparation with a safety data sheet compiled in accordance with annex ii :
it is crucial that we resume discussions on the draft framework decision on racism and xenophobia , because we will only be able to combat these phenomena effectively and consistently throughout eu territory if we adopt an integrated approach that involves both preventative and punitive measures .
this shall not apply to the manufacture , placing on the market or use of a substance in scientific research and development .
safety significance , if any , of a change in physical appearance of the substance or preparation ,
this annex shall also apply adapted as necessary to producers and importers of articles required to make a chemical safety assessment as part of a registration .
communists are fighting for the brotherhood of peoples and workers the world over , irrespective of gender , race , colour or creed .
if points ( a ) , ( b ) or ( c ) apply , the manufacturer or importer shall submit , along with the dossier , an explanation as to why the costs would be disproportionate , why disclosure of information was likely to lead to substantial commercial detriment , or the nature of the disagreement , as the case may be .
the agency shall perform a further completeness check , considering the further information submitted .
thus the information to be considered includes information related to the hazards of the substance , the exposure arising from the manufacture or import , the identified uses of the substance , operational conditions and risk management measures applied or recommended to downstream users to be taken into account .
human beings , after all , are capable of both wonderful deeds and abominable behaviour , as history has shown .
each image reminds us of the horror of human complicity , and the eternal risk that this might happen again , because we do not know how far evil can go .
substances which result from a chemical reaction that occurs incidental to exposure of another substance or article to environmental factors such as air , moisture , microbial organisms or sunlight .
step 1 generation of exposure scenario ( s ) or the generation of relevant use and exposure categories .
to them first of all , but also to our children and to future generations , because those who would insensitively deny the holocaust or , worse , attempt to trivialise it , have not waited for the survivors to disappear before trying to demean this most singular of memories .
i believe that this house has always supported democracy and opposed dictatorships .
children also need to understand the consequences of regimes based on totalitarian ideologies - the nazi responsibility for the holocaust is clear ; the communist regimes in the soviet union and china have also committed mass murder on an enormous scale .
it consists primarily of the glycerides of the fatty acids linoleic , linolenic and oleic ( linum usitatissimum , linaceae ) .
if it is not possible to identify a dnel , then this shall be clearly stated and fully justified .
such a ban has existed in hungary for over ten years .
in this case , the lead registrant shall identify the other registrants specifying :

so , through you , i am asking mr borrell to ensure that we get some correct answers from commissioner kallas , for , if mr borrell does not do that , then this parliament and the whole hearings process will fall further into disrepute .

member states shall establish national helpdesks to provide advice to manufacturers , importers , downstream users and any other interested parties on their respective responsibilities and obligations under this regulation , in particular in relation to the registration of substances in accordance with article 12 ( 1 ) , in addition to the operational guidance documents provided by the agency under article 77 ( 2 ) ( g ) .

the british government is continuing to hide the truth of mr finucane &apos;s murder for its own political reasons .
the objective of the hazard assessment for physicochemical properties shall be to determine the classification and labelling of a substance in accordance with directive 67 / 548 / eec .
an exposure scenario is the set of conditions that describe how the substance is manufactured or used during its life-cycle and how the manufacturer or importer controls , or recommends downstream users to control , exposures of humans and the environment .
skin protection
for registrants , the person identified shall be consistent with the information on the identity of the manufacturer or importer provided in the registration .
if the melting point is between 200 ° c and 300 ° c , a limit value based on measurement or a recognised calculation method is sufficient .
the address was subsequently printed in , the leading polish daily , under the striking title of &quot; the humiliation of a christian . &quot;
mr buttiglione complained that the european parliament did not endorse his candidature for commissioner because of his views on homosexuality .
i shall spare you his other accusations and come to my conclusion , which is the following .
mention the number ( s ) given in this annex or annexes vii to x , as appropriate .
a comparison of the predicted environmental concentrations in each environmental sphere with the pnecs , and
other adverse effects
the emission estimation shall be performed under the assumption that the risk management measures and operational conditions described in the exposure scenario have been implemented .

where exposure cannot be prevented by other means the use of individual protection measures , such as personal protection equipment .
beware of the cult of money , and of perceiving the market as the only purpose of life , as this is bound to result in the annihilation of western civilisation .
ladies and gentlemen , with regard to the matter of the budget and the funding earmarked for the meeting of young people with the pope in cologne , i should like to make it clear that if anyone else managed to bring together so many young people for a good cause , i would certainly vote in favour of providing funding for the meeting .
describe the most important adverse physicochemical , human health and environmental effects and symptoms relating to the uses and possible misuses of the substance or preparation that can reasonably be foreseen .
and one more thing ! good legislation is fine , but what is more important is that we actually put good legislation into practice .
this information will be taken into account by the employer in carrying out an assessment of risk to the health and safety of workers for the substance or preparation under article 4 of directive 98 / 24 / ec , which requires , in the order of priority :
respiratory system
implemented or recommended risk management , including the degree of containment ,
europe is obliged to help those who for some reason have lagged behind to catch up and expand their economies .
it is vitally important that economic growth be equally spread around all european regions .
where a chemical safety report is required , the information on the waste management measures that adequately control exposure of humans and the environment to the substance shall be consistent with the exposure scenarios set out in the annex to the safety data sheet .
i should also like to remind members from the ten new member states , and not only those from the group of the european people &apos;s party ( christian democrats ) and european democrats , but also those who are socialists , greens , communists or non-attached members , that it is thanks to the pope and his actions that we are able to discuss a common europe together today .
there are other examples of such practices , and i would therefore call on mr barroso to ensure that the commission monitors the application of legislation very closely as far as the principle of non-discrimination is concerned .
we need more optimism and confidence , more serious intent , more clarity and scrutiny and the political will to honour the pledges we make from our soap boxes .

it consists primarily of the glycerides of the fatty acids linoleic , oleic , palmitic and stearic ( soja hispida , leguminosae ) .
chemical safety report format
the available information indicates that the substance should be classified for skin sensitisation or corrosivity , or
may i therefore make this request to the president of the commission : apply a subsidiarity test before the presentation of proposals .
glycerides , c16-18 and c18-unsaturated
exposure scenarios shall cover any manufacture in the community and all identified uses .
i also have a particular appeal to make in this matter , which is that the commission must attach high priority in the framework of this legislative programme , as in other areas , to the implementation of its interinstitutional agreement with the council and parliament .
contact person
consumer use .
both of the competent vice-presidents of the european commission - the one who signed the paper in lisbon and the one who signed the programme we are discussing today - are socialists .
the greater the commitment among the member states to implement the necessary reforms , the more quickly such a culture can be introduced .
in accordance with section 3 of annex xi in some cases , it may not be necessary to generate missing information , because risk management measures and operational conditions which are necessary to control a well-characterised risk may also be sufficient to control other potential risks , which will not therefore need to be characterised precisely .
hydrolysis as a function of ph .
for some substances or preparations it may be important to emphasise that special means to provide specific and immediate treatment shall be available at the workplace .
environmental exposure controls
if you are serious about your partnership with us , and indeed with all the institutions , you will have to go much further yet .
if you had confined yourself to what was essential , the members of this house would have been the first to say that you had forgotten this or that issue they considered more important .
cas no 67-66-3
mr president , president barroso , ladies and gentlemen , allow me to make a few personal observations on the commission &apos;s work programme .
these substances and preparations shall not :
if the rate of nickel release from the parts of these articles coming into direct and prolonged contact with the skin is greater than 0,5 μg / cm2 / week ;
the strengthening of security in europe does indeed remain a priority , yet it must not on any account be strengthened at the expense of civil liberties .
we are therefore pleased to note that priority has been given to the implementation of european legislation , but we want firm commitments for future years .
controlled closed dry cleaning systems where the washing liquid is recycled or incinerated ,
&quot; for use in industrial installations only . &quot;
results are adequate for the purpose of classification and labelling and / or risk assessment ; and
the assessment shall consider all stages of the life-cycle of the substance resulting from the manufacture and identified uses .
the study does not need to be conducted below a lower limit of - 20 ° c .
mr barroso sensibly understands that many remedies for the lack of economic dynamism lie in the hands of member states themselves .
we want to see a renewed commitment to the completion of the single market .
it may be necessary to mention other hazards , such as dustiness , cross-sensitisation , suffocation , freezing , high potency for odour or taste or environmental effects such as hazards to soil-dwelling organisms , ozone depletion , photochemical ozone creation potential , etc . , which do not result in classification but which may contribute to the overall hazards of the material .

i look forward to , and am confident that i will see , some progress soon on all these issues in relation to the services directive , which i am so pleased he supports .
the report , referred to in article 117 ( 4 ) , on the experience acquired with the operation of this regulation shall include a review of the requirements relating to registration of substances manufactured or imported only in quantities starting at one tonne but less than 10 tonnes per year per manufacturer or importer .
your statement , mr president , did not entirely satisfy me , because the question of services cannot be reduced to market economics .
our public services are part of our own identity ; whether they be postal services or local transport , they are part of the european identity , which the people of europe rightly want to see defended .
this substance is identified by sda substance name : c16-c18 and c18 unsaturated alkyl carboxylic acid and sda reporting no : 11-005-00 .
this implies an urgent need for something more than the neighbourhood policy , because the alternative is increased pressure to narrow the focus of discussions prematurely onto full membership , which we could not deliver immediately , because it would overstretch the integrative capacity of the european union .
us policy , indeed , is sounding an entirely new note here .
toxicity for reproduction
in scientific research and development ;
what the citizens of europe should be informed about is not the impenetrable constitution , but the mountain of eu legislation which will pass through the eu &apos;s institutions this year - legislation dreamt up by a defunct commission and approved by an expired parliament , both of whom are no longer accountable to the people this programme will affect .
the document states that , due to the institutional changeover in 2004 , a lighter procedure than usual was adopted for the european parliament to consider the policy strategy .

the european parliament , the european commission and the eu governments are going to have to work together closely if the objectives of the lisbon strategy are to be met .

for that purpose , until such time as the executive director takes up his duties following his appointment by the management board of the agency in accordance with article 84 , the commission , on behalf of the agency , and using the budget provided for the latter , may :
it is simply wrong that america and europe operate under two different accountancy models .
the information shall also include the result of the comparison of the available data with the criteria given in directive 67 / 548 / eec for cmr , categories 1 and 2 , following paragraph 1.3.1 of annex i of this regulation .
the competent authority shall update this information as appropriate .

human health hazard assessment .
together with the council , amend the stability pact to make expenditure on education and training count as investment , thereby eliminating it from the calculation of the debt ratio .
protect small and medium-sized enterprises by using the directives adopted by the last parliament , such as the directive on software patents , as the basis for a new proposal .
do not argue for more effective military options , but only for peaceful solutions .
campaign for better protection of the environment , and remember that there is certainly still work to be done here in the european union in fields such as biodiversity , the avoidance and recycling of waste and the sustainable use of resources .
this legislative programme has been shaped largely by the annual policy strategy , which was published by the last commission in february 2004 .
the study does not need to be conducted if :
the exposure levels estimated in section 6.2 do not exceed the appropriate dnel or the pnec , as determined in sections 1 and 3 , respectively , and ,
the european commission is the unelected government of the eu , but what other government anywhere in the world would have its legislative programme set out by its predecessor ?
the potential of the substance or the appropriate constituents of a preparation &#91; 61 &#93; this information cannot be given for the preparation because it is substance specific .
if , in the case of a decision as referred to in paragraph 2 ( a ) , the provisional measure taken by the member state consists in a restriction on the placing on the market or use of a substance , the member state concerned shall initiate a community restrictions procedure by submitting to the agency a dossier , in accordance with annex xv , within three months of the date of the commission decision .
we have to bring the turkish cypriots in from the cold .
i believe that , following condoleezza rice &apos;s charm offensive in europe , it must and it will emerge in the coming days and weeks - and the iran issue will be the acid test - whether we have only one common goal and continue to go our own separate ways , or whether we manage to develop multilateral measures and avert the danger of unilateralism , which we saw during the preventive war against iraq .
on behalf of my group , may i warmly encourage you and strongly urge the commission to make every effort in the forthcoming talks to persuade the us administration to lend its active support to the negotiating strategy of the three eu representatives .
step 2 exposure estimation .
step 2 does not need to be conducted if :
where applicable , an indication of the uses which the registrant advises against and why ( i.e. non-statutory recommendations by supplier ) .
step 3 identification of the pnec
the likely pathways to the environment and environmental distribution and degradation and / or transformation ( see also section 3 step 1 ) ,
as long as this is the main thrust of your commission &apos;s policies , the climate will never change in favour of the eu .
then , a few days later , i found an interview with you in the in which you took a completely different line from the one you had presented when you addressed this parliament .

a second remark , mr president ; in our most recent discussion of your work programme , i said on behalf of our group that we saw the glass as half full .

i am well aware of where your political affiliation lies .
if the available information is not sufficient to decide whether the substance fulfils the criteria in annex xiii , then other evidence like monitoring data available for the registrant and giving rise to an equivalent level of concern shall be considered on a case-by-case basis .
but enough of these pleasantries , for i also have one or two remarks to make that i believe you will be less happy to hear .

mrs grossetête , given the substance of your speech , i cordially invite you to join us , and we shall quickly secure majorities for socially responsible policies in the european union .

in the field of policy , we would emphasise euro-mediterranean relations .
if applicable , the name of the substance as given in einecs ;
important health , safety and environmental information
in particular , we must also improve young people &apos;s mobility by facilitating university exchanges and having people benefit from the terrific experience constituted by career routes to the professions .
substances for which it is predicted ( ie by the application of ( q ) sars or other evidence ) that they are likely to meet the criteria for category 1 or 2 classification for carcinogenicity , mutagenicity or reproductive toxicity or the criteria in annex xiii ;
as far as solidarity policy is concerned , it is only right that the new member states should benefit from these programmes , but do not forget that the funds in question also convey the image of the european union across all the member states .
the purpose of this annex is to set out how manufacturers and importers are to assess and document that the risks arising from the substance they manufacture or import are adequately controlled during manufacture and their own use ( s ) and that others further down the supply chain can adequately control the risks .
these two policies are not contradictory , in fact quite the opposite is true ; they are complementary .
the likelihood and severity of an event occurring due to the physicochemical properties of the substance as determined in section 2 is negligible .
i have in mind the development of renewable energy sources , including solar and wind power , of biofuels and of clean forms of transport - all sectors that offer our industries a real opportunity in terms of employment and exports .
indicate any special precautions which a user needs to be aware of or needs to comply with in connection with transport or conveyance either within or outside his premises .
to summarise , mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i want the work programme for 2005 to be the first achievement of the partnership i am proposing to you for the renewal of europe .
i shall be happy to hear now your comments and suggestions regarding its content .

competent authorities shall submit electronically to the agency any available information that they hold on substances registered in accordance with article 12 ( 1 ) whose dossiers do not contain the full information referred to in annex vii , in particular whether enforcement or monitoring activities have identified suspicions of risk .
wherever practicable , registrations should be submitted jointly , in accordance with articles 11 or 19 .
i want the commission to be helpful in this regard .
if possible , reference shall be made to industry- or sector-specific approved guidance .
for this purpose , the commission intends to adopt a list of just over 100 priority initiatives by the end of the year .

clearly , such a mechanism will respect the independence of judicial authority , and will involve the national parliaments and the judiciary &apos;s governing bodies .
we are all aware , however , that in addition to mutual recognition , there must also be a minimum level of harmonisation .

. - mr president , mr frattini , ladies and gentlemen , implementing the area of freedom , security and justice is one of the most stimulating challenges facing the eu , of which the most important element , as we proposed in the hague programme , is the need to ensure high quality justice throughout union territory , without prejudice to the plurality of the existing judicial systems in the 25 member states .
i believe , then , that the commission also has the duty to issue directives and recommendations , so that the efforts we are making to improve the quality of justice in europe and in the member states are not derailed by a particular member state for its own very special reasons .
i therefore begin this initiative report by proposing that there should be a mutual evaluation mechanism among the various member states .

what we are seeing today - what is clearly visible - is that , at the davos forum , a certain effort at corporate social responsibility is being made and an increasingly strong emphasis is being placed on a programme for global government or governance .
today &apos;s globalisation is not the result of a decision made by any one country or group of countries , and nor is it a conspiracy on the part of a group of companies .

the answer to globalisation must not come from europe alone ; what is needed is a debate on a model world order .
our understanding of fundamental freedoms and human rights , our rejection of the death penalty , of child labour and of discrimination of any kind , our concept of what it means to be human ; all these things know no borders , whether these be borders of countries or of continents , and it is in this sense that we also bear responsibility for what happens in the rest of the world .
we need a global code of ethics and global principles of action , in spite of the fact that different cultures exist .

mr president , the world social forum was originally initiated as a counterpoint to the world economic forum in davos with the intention of trying to force social issues onto the globalisation agenda .

at this , its fifth meeting , there are over 150 000 participants from 150 countries and , amongst the hundreds of meetings , representatives of the imf and the world bank face their critics for the first time .
aid carries with it the poison pill of conditionality that forces the opening of the markets to privatisation of state assets , and the straitjacket of monetarist policies .
a decision on the need to perform a study at this tonnage level or the next on a second species should be based on the outcome of the first test and all other relevant available date .
yet the fact that the imf and the world bank are now &quot; talking the talk , but not walking the walk &quot; suggests that pressure from civic society can have an impact .

it also allows us to pursue a more environmentally-friendly policy as a result .
i welcome the leadership of the commission president to opt for the latter .
mr president , president of the commission , ladies and gentlemen , i had the honour of participating in the meeting of the world economic forum as part of the young global leaders programme .

it is not only in recent times , though , that reality has had a different tale to tell , and this makes it even more important that the world economic forum in davos and the world social forum in porto alegre should examine , on a regular basis , the methods employed by globalisation and the effects resulting from it .

ladies and gentlemen , the meeting of the world economic forum in davos was a resounding success .
this annex lays down general principles for preparing dossiers to propose and justify :
a risk characterisation shall be carried out for each new exposure scenario as prescribed in section 6 of annex i. the risk characterisation shall be presented under the relevant heading of the chemical safety report and summarised in the safety data sheet under the relevant heading ( s ) .
i believe that one of the other important contributions of the social forums has been to root the challenge to liberal globalisation , to the economic and social injustices it creates and to its often destructive consequences for the ecological balance of the planet , not in the false belief that national or sovereigntist solutions had to be found , and not in a rejection of the very idea of globalisation , but in the view that globalisation and its rules and institutions must be transformed , in order to allow for a different kind of globalisation , a globalisation of solidarity , of democratic triumphs and of human rights , a globalisation that guarantees the right of all peoples to development , justice and peace .

i was proud to see that european leaders such as jacques chirac , tony blair and gerhard schröder were ready to set the pace .
i took two key messages away with me from davos .
nevertheless , the representation of civil society is increasing in the world economic forum , and there is a broadening range of participants in the world social forum .
first , we should not deny that , while the agenda are converging , the two audiences are looking at the issues involved from different angles .
the half-life in fresh- or estuarine water is higher than 40 days , or
it is defined as much by our formal gatherings in the wto , the world bank , the g8 as by the more informal settings provided by the world social forum or the world economic forum .

we need a strong commission .
that is why i believe that your proposal is not a good one .
however , we cannot do so by reducing the importance of the commission and by asking the commissioners to be civil servants .
instead , we must ask them to assume their political responsibilities , to exercise their citizenship and to express their preferences , always while working in a european spirit of course .
toys and childcare articles containing these phthalates in a concentration higher than 0,1 % by mass of the plasticised material shall not be placed on the market .

appropriate in vivo mutagenicity studies shall be considered in case of a positive result in any of the genotoxicity studies in annex vii or viii .

they want to know whether the european commission , the european parliament and the council are working along the same lines and whether or not they are genuinely concerned about their problems .

all i did was express my solidarity with the party of which i was president for several years .
there was therefore no failure to honour obligations .
as , moreover , you acknowledged , i did not , where this matter was concerned , fail to honour any obligation , because the commission &apos;s code of conduct clearly allows commissioners to be active members of political parties and unions .

the appropriate route shall be chosen on the following basis :
sufficient documentation is provided to assess the adequacy of the study ; and
testing for a specific endpoint may be omitted , if it is technically not possible to conduct the study as a consequence of the properties of the substance : e.g. very volatile , highly reactive or unstable substances cannot be used , mixing of the substance with water may cause danger of fire or explosion or the radio-labelling of the substance required in certain studies may not be possible .

having said that , the members of the commission are political men and women .
this institution - the commission - must be strong and must work with a strong parliament , firmly committed to change and reforms and with the sense of balance that is at the heart of our europe .

security , justice and the protection of fundamental rights will be one of the commission &apos;s priorities .

this is why - and i say this partly in response to mr goebbels - we have of course had to draw up a list of our main objectives .

although the committee on economic and monetary affairs has , at my proposal , followed this suggestion in the first instance , i do think that we should review the practical implications in a few years &quot; time , because we have no idea of how many businesses , how much state aid in total , and how many applications for state aid are involved .
solvent naphtha ( coal ) ; light oil extract residues , high boiling
it is unfortunate that no amendments have been tabled to do away with that misconception , but i would in any event like to make this clear to the commission in today &apos;s plenary .

what is ultimately the extent of state aid that you do not only entertain , but also must take into consideration ?
as i have said before further to the discussion on mr jonathan evans &quot; report , i agree that we must cover all the angles in order to proceed in a more transparent and more effective way , thereby cutting down on bureaucracy and red tape , which does not benefit anybody , is too time-consuming , and , as mrs in &quot; t veld put it very graphically , ultimately , what matters is the public , the consumers and taxpayers , who want to know what happens with their money and to what effect .
the intention is to use state aid as a way of setting in motion a process that will , eventually , lead to self-sufficiency .
we must finally put this into practice and ask ourselves whether it would not be a good idea - i , for one , think it is one , and it is one that i am glad to adopt - to submit a report in four years or so to demonstrate the impact of it all , and check whether it has the desired effect or whether there are maybe better methods for achieving our goal .
however , we do come up against the court ruling in the altmark case , which brings us to the fourth criterion .
however , in some cases where liberalisation has taken place there are still activities within that market that we do not accept .
we need to ensure that they have access to risk capital because they need to take their ideas forward .

the next item is the report by mrs in &apos; t veld on state aid in the form of public service compensation .
the first one is that on the one hand , we have state aid rules which must ensure that the internal market operates effectively , and on the other hand , the treaty also states that those rules must not hinder the proper functioning of public services .
paraffin waxes ( coal ) , brown-coal-high-temperature tar , hydrotreated ; coal tar extract

we are opposed to the prevention of a possible liberalisation of services of general interest by means of derogations to the directive on services , such as has been attempted by the federal minister for the economy in germany .
it consists of hydrocarbons having carbon numbers predominantly in the range of c4 through c11 and boiling in the range of approximately - 20 ° c to 190 ° c . )
these include the drawing up by the member states of a definition of services of general interest ; even if these definitions are not identical , they will be comparable , and we do not regard this as violating the principle of subsidiarity .
distillates ( petroleum ) , clay-treated middle ; gas oil - unspecified ( a complex combination of hydrocarbons resulting from treatment of a petroleum fraction with natural or modified clay , usually in a percolation process to remove the trace amounts of polar compounds and impurities present .
the report affirms our belief in the importance of high-quality services of general interest that are accessible to all .
i am also firmly convinced that unless the commission speeds up the procedures for assessing internationally comparable best practice models , we run the risk of having to submit a negative final or interim report in four years &quot; time .
i particularly agree with the comments made by the penultimate speaker , mr klinz of the group of the alliance of liberals and democrats for europe , namely that the priority for brussels must be greater transparency in order to resolve this problem , and that there is a risk that the smaller member states will continue to use subsidiarity to their own advantage , either by imposing artificially high prices or by helping their friends .
there is a widespread feeling that practices that used to be well-established are being called into question , in particular in the case of services of general interest and possible compensation for the provision of public services , and this has left a great many people fearing that they will be left with nothing at all .
in those cases where tendering is possible , it is obvious that we need to apply the four criteria , but in other cases , people need to take the best possible decision under the given circumstances , and we have to conclude that we need to gain some experience in that area in order to formulate the best methodology .
four years are a good timeframe within which we can make some valid statements on this score and hopefully reach some conclusions again in a future debate .
we are happy with this and we will support this same line tomorrow .
a clear decision was achieved in committee that gives the commission a strong steer .
naphtha ; low boiling point naphtha ( refined , partly refined , or unrefined petroleum products by the distillation of natural gas .
i will give an example : an amendment i tabled , and that i am pleased to note was accepted in this report , makes it easier to supply aid from the air , as well through sea routes between islands .
without any doubt , there are cases of abuses , but there are several other cases , where , if properly regulated , state aid will be the social soul that arrives where the cold calculations of the market &apos;s reasoning do not .
i think that whoever believes in balance , recognises that the market economy has several advantages , although we must , at the same time , recognise that intolerable shortcomings keep occurring , and those who are entrusted with power and leadership do not budge .

there are those who say that these subsidies go against the laws of the european union .

( the residue obtained from coal tar oil by an alkaline wash such as aqueous sodium hydroxide after the removal of crude coal tar acids. composed primarily of naphthalenes and aromatic nitrogen bases . )
i can assure you of my commitment to ensuring an ongoing and constructive dialogue on competition issues with this house .
such competition releases considerable dynamism and energy into european society , and not only where development , growth and new jobs are concerned .
we have the pressure of external competition resulting from globalisation and that of internal competition , reinforced by enlargement and the internal market .
i believe we have to be aware of the fact that what , right now , is the driving force in the european union and in the work on developing and modernising our society is competition .
i also wish to express my appreciation of mrs kroes &apos;s contribution and emphasise that i am among those who look forward with high hopes to possible further contributions of hers .

these amendments clarified a range of points , not least that competitiveness is an essential factor in fostering growth in europe , although this is only one of the objectives of the lisbon strategy , equally as important as cohesion and the environment .

mr president , i have no difficulty with the sensible exchange of information about criminal convictions between member states , but only the politically blind could fail to recognise the proposals in the costa report as part of the harmonisation process that is under way in the criminal justice system across europe .
if we were not attentive to the balance between these two elements , criminal law would be effectively unified , but it would not necessarily be democratically legitimised .
that is not serving the interests of the british nation in my view and therefore i will oppose that report .
a comparison of the available information with the criteria for cmrs , respiratory sensitisers and other effects on a case by case basis in directive 67 / 548 / eec according to the relevant parts of section 1 of annex i shall be completed and documented in the format set out in part b of the chemical safety report in annex i .
commissioner , it is not merely that we are struggling to keep up with the real nature of crime today , given that for many years now organised crime has no longer been the only kind of crime that crosses borders ; we are also struggling to keep up with individual crime .
unfortunately , the impression is sometimes given that information is requested and delivered by telegram , and it therefore needs to flow better .
dissociation constant
despite the numerous fears that have been expressed , this would not mean any reduction in the level of data protection ; after all , information relating to certain types of specialised crime committed in kehl is just as important in offenburg as in strasbourg .
the aim was to do away with a system that was in itself unnecessarily bureaucratic so as to redirect the resources of the commission to cracking down properly on hard-core cartels .
i know our new commissioner also shares this view in relation to the legacy of mr monti , because only recently she has been speaking at bocconi university and making very similar remarks about mr monti &apos;s contribution .

that is what the operation of an effective competition policy is all about .
as mr di pietro rightly said , it is not a question of new data but of data on convictions , which can be used by judges .
however , member states may , for reasons of protection of human health , prohibit the use of such articles before they are disposed of or reach the end of their service life .
the guidance given in the test methods referred to in article 13 ( 3 ) , more specifically on the technical limitations of a specific method , shall always be respected .
the next item is the report by mr jonathan evans ( a6-24 / 2005 ) , on behalf of the committee on economic and monetary affairs , on the commission &apos;s xxxiiird report on competition policy - 2003 ( 2004 / 2139 ( ini ) ) .
description of the analytical methods shall be provided on request , for the relevant compartments for which studies were performed using the analytical method concerned .
long-term toxicity to sediment organisms
perhaps we should worry about harmonising the rules : the rules about what a criminal association is and how and why the head of a criminal organisation can be punished vary too much from one country to another .
. - mr president , i am grateful to the rapporteurs and the members who have spoken , even for calling on the commission to act and to act quickly .
in addition to the specific rules set out in column 2 of annexes vii to x , a registrant may adapt the standard testing regime in accordance with the general rules set out in section 1 of this annex .
it should not solely consider the main strands of the process and the serving of sentences , but should be extended to cover the substantive rules , the politics of defining offences and to the criteria for setting sentences .
accordingly , the information required in column 1 of this annex is additional to that required in column 1 of annex vii .
you are aware that the subject of temporary custody , or detention prior to conviction , is one in which people &apos;s rights to freedom have to be weighed against the state &apos;s right to prosecute criminals .
however , if the paints have a high zinc content , their residual concentration of cadmium shall be as low as possible and shall at all events not exceed 0,1 % by mass .
i turn now to the exchange of information , which is a more sensitive area .
long-term toxicity testing shall be proposed by the registrant if the chemical safety assessment according to annex i indicates the need to investigate further the effects on aquatic organisms .
in this connection , i really pin a lot of hope on commissioner frattini &apos;s further efforts .
i would first of all point to the fact that , in a number of member states , criminal procedure and the prison systems contain numerous gross infringements of fundamental human rights .
&quot; whoopee &quot; cushions ,
the report &apos;s single ambition is to cultivate mutual trust in the principle of mutual recognition of the other member states &quot; legal decisions .
processing with no release into waste water ,
i can say that my group is in favour of a european public prosecutor &apos;s office ; we are in favour of a european criminal code , of europe-wide rights for suspects and for victims , of the sharing of information and , above all , in favour of a hefty investment in the in-depth training of all police and judicial officers in european cooperation .

cement and cement-containing preparations shall not be used or placed on the market , if they contain , when hydrated , more than 0,0002 % soluble chromium vi of the total dry weight of the cement .
mr president , both reports are expressions of the well-known ambition to extend the power of the eu institutions at the expense both of the member states and ultimately , therefore , of democracy
we will wait impatiently , as mr frattini announced , for more general proposals , which are essential if we are to combat terrorism , serious crime and crime in general more effectively .
it does , of course , presuppose that the member states work together effectively , that they can look beyond their own borders and know how things are done elsewhere , that they are also agreed on a number of basic standards , for example in terms of law of criminal procedure and , above all , build on the trust in each other and on the reasons why they can indeed trust in each other .
mr president , this evening , we are once again discussing the magic word &quot; mutual recognition &quot; as the cornerstone of european judicial cooperation .
there is a host of new proposals in the making , and they all constitute small steps forward , on paper anyway , for in my experience , member states very often put the brakes on .
grouping of substances and read-across approach
socio-economic assessment
in my opinion , this report sends a strong signal from parliament to the commission and the council .
ensuring and checking that judges are properly trained , open-minded , level-headed , alert , efficient , conscientious and able to manage the existing means as well as possible clearly does not run counter to the essential independence they must have .
in addition , freedom of movement in europe enables criminal networks to profit from the opening up of the european union &apos;s internal borders while at the same time exploiting the lack of european coordination with regard to justice and thus evading capture .
we must therefore now adopt the necessary mechanisms to meet the new challenges now facing european judicial cooperation .
the commission shall re-evaluate , by 16 january 2010 , the measures provided for in relation to this point in the light of new scientific information on such substances and their substitutes , and if justified , these measures shall be modified accordingly .
such mechanisms and practical measures must be put in place in order to improve mutual trust in europe &apos;s judicial systems , which is an absolute necessity .
1 shall not be used on their own or in the form of preparations in aerosol generators that are placed on the market for the general public for entertainment and decorative purposes such as the following :
this is because the current lack of trust constitutes a major barrier to achieving mutual recognition of current practices and to reaching an appropriate level of approximation of judicial systems .

wider implications on trade , competition and economic development ( in particular for smes and in relation to third countries ) of a granted or refused authorisation , or a proposed restriction .
in this context , it is vital to improve judicial cooperation in criminal and civil matters .
in this regard i propose to the commission that it does indeed speed up the construction of the information technology system .
alkanes , c10-c13 , chloro ( short-chain chlorinated paraffins ) ( sccps )
in view of the extensive range of the provisions in the constitutional treaty for europe regarding the convergence of national legislations in the area of criminal , material and procedural law , we may conclude that the plan for a single criminal law area is taking on an increasingly clear outline .
einecs no 202-080-4
although the greek judicial system is now putting its house in order , that is not enough .
the similarities may be based on :
this task will be complicated somewhat by the fact that allowance must be made for the varying legal systems which are in place in the different member states and which are based on different legal traditions and cultures , as well as for the different judicial systems .
in my opinion , it would therefore be a good idea for the european commission to comply with the report &apos;s recommendations by starting to develop the criteria and methods to be used in carrying out such assessments .
.
although a specific legal basis for such an assessment will not be provided until the constitutional treaty is in force , i believe that a general legal basis can already be found in the treaty of maastricht .
it is for this reason that my political group welcomes the costa report , which contains recommendations to the european commission relating to the establishment of a quality charter for criminal justice , as the fundamental rights granted to defendants , victims and barristers by the proposed charter may at the same time be used as criteria for a mutual assessment of the quality of justice .
mr president , both the tampere programme , and later the hague programme , identified the mutual recognition of judgments in criminal cases as one of the european union &apos;s goals in the field of criminal law .
it is , after all , a supplement to the convention on mutual assistance in criminal matters , which dates back to 1959 .
moreover , the proposal is inadequate and does not offer an answer to a large number of problems .
the half-life in marine , fresh- or estuarine water sediment is higher than 180 days , or
the assessment of the persistency in the environment shall be based on available half-life data collected under the adequate conditions , which shall be described by the registrant .
the proposal that is now being debated is far too long in coming .
the exchange of information from the criminal register is another issue worth considering .
the information shall be provided for one of the sections 9.1.6.1 , 9.1.6.2 or 9.1.6.3 .

i would say to mr radwan that the question before us is not whether we are exceeding the speed limit , but whether we want to drive slowly in a mercedes , and it strikes me that , at the moment , this is more or less the case with the stability and growth pact .
we in europe have to realise that the world is not flat and that we are engaged in global competition .
the economic situation , as regards the stability and growth pact , has a different meaning depending on the size of the country ; it is inadequate to say that all member states are alike when it comes to the pact .
it is crystal free at approximately 38 ° c . )
firstly , i feel that a good reform is one that provides the union with a macroeconomic instrument with which to implement the lisbon strategy .
secondly , there are those who say that , for accounting reasons , the manner in which one member state or another pursues structural reforms in the area of retirement could come under the heading of &quot; taking expenditure into account . &quot;

the fact that these are common problems is clear from the workers &apos; demonstrations being held in most countries against the cost of living , unemployment , low wages , redundancies , the privatisation of the health , education and welfare sectors , longer working times , insecurity and uncertainty about the future .
the labelling of any article intended for domestic use which is not covered by section 5 and which is likely , during use , to release asbestos fibres shall , if necessary , contain the following safety instruction : &quot; replace when worn . &quot;
however , the best response is a fight in the form of organised disobedience to this policy and a counter-attack designed to bring about its radical change .
these are signs which express the workers &apos; feelings of indifference and that is why they are turning their back on the european union .
a country with a debt ratio of less than 60 % of gdp and which keeps inflation below 2 % will have a decreasing debt ratio if its economy grows in real terms by one percentage point or more and if the budget deficit amounts to 3 % .
or , if the abovementioned is not reasonably practicable as in the case of , for example , smallness of size of the article , the unsuitable nature of the article &apos;s properties or certain technical difficulties by means of a hand-out with labelling in accordance with 3.1 .

( a neutral oil obtained by debasing and dephenolating the oil obtained from the distillation of high temperature tar and pyrolysis residual oils which has a boiling range of 225 to 255 ° c. composed primarily of substituted dinuclear aromatic hydrocarbons . )
we are aware that ministers at the ecofin council meeting are preparing the text for the reform , but parliament must not opt out of the debate .
it would therefore be desirable , prior to the final decision by the council , for parliament to have an opportunity to express its views on the procedures for reform of the pact by holding a debate on the subject .
the resources we spend on paying interests and paying off public debt will mean less resources for guaranteeing finances .
without those coordination rules , making the stability pact more flexible would be equivalent to breaking it and breaking the stability pact would mean neutralising the central bank &apos;s efforts to maintain prices , it would mean rises in interest rates , it would mean a delay in growth , which is what we all want , a delay in the implementation of the structural reforms and , more dangerously , a serious threat to the welfare state .
for any environmental sphere , for which no effect information is available , the relevant section of the chemical safety report shall contain the sentence : &quot; this information is not available . &quot;

you should read your texts through once before you adopt them , that would be a great help !
but you know very well that structural reforms can only work , and can only lead to more growth and higher employment if they form part of an active industrial policy , part of an active policy for small and medium-sized enterprises and part of a budgetary policy appropriate to our economic situation .
europe stands to gain more from that .

firstly , there has been a considerable delay in implementing the lisbon strategy .
that is why close examination of the lisbon strategy and also of its link with the reform of the stability and the growth pact is necessary ; that is also why my group is still keen to underline in that discussion that we should focus on investments and also on how we , within the parameters prescribed in that stability and growth pact , should draw a distinction between current expenses and expenses that are really intended for investment in that knowledge economy that we seek as part of that lisbon strategy .
furthermore , as regards the institutions and the allocation of powers , the eu has exclusive competence in the area of competition law and monetary union ; otherwise , the member states must cope and must compete with one another .

the reality presented in the report is that over the last decade the eu economy has grown well below its potential , with a decrease not only in private investment but also in gross public investment , which in the euro area has fallen from 4 % of gdp in the early 1970s to 2.4 % .

i am optimistic about the possibility of reaching an agreement at the european council of 22 and 23 march which maintains the principles and reference values of the treaty , as well as the pillars of fiscal and budgetary discipline laid down in the treaty , which we must all respect .
it will be very positive for the two important issues being debated in parliament today and being debated in the commission and in the council to come together at the march european council , so that we can reach a forward-looking agreement , improving the relationship between the two strategies and , of course , keeping a clear view of the principles of each of them .

we should then , in actual fact , be in danger of undermining the stable condition for growth constituted by low interest rates .
germany &apos;s present contention that the costs of reunification have so far been left out of the equation is an example of how insincere the debate has become , because germany has complied with the stability and growth criteria since the beginning of this decade ; it has gone along with the stability and growth pact and has had no problems with it for 10 years .

compensation for services of general economic interest that have only a minor impact on the internal market is frequently granted on a strictly limited and local basis , and is therefore a good example of an instance where exemption would be decided on .
under this proposal , compensation that only has a very minor impact on the internal market will be exempt from state aid control procedures , which will mean a great deal more legal certainty for local stakeholders .
this proposal complies with the demand parliament made in its resolution of 14 january 2004 on the green paper on services of general interest , and it is a sign that support exists for a control policy that focuses on cases that are key to effective competition in the internal market .

we shall work with you , because your agreement is necessary .
oj l 150 , 3.6.2006 , p . 6 .
i say yes , for example , to opening up service markets , but i say no to social dumping , an element that some people would like to promote .
maize and sorghum
we cannot change strategy every six months , from council to council , according to the whims of the presidencies and to what is inspiring them at the time .
it must be subject to a broad review every two years , or preferably every three years .
it is recalled that dumping during the rip was still present and that there exists a likelihood of continuation of dumping of the product concerned originating in the usa and of recurrence of injury to the community industry .
for the partial invitation to tender ending on 19 october 2006 , the maximum export refund for the product referred to in article 1 ( 1 ) of regulation ( ec ) no 958 / 2006 shall be 28,558 eur / 100 kg .
annexes i and vii are hereby amended as follows :
we are going to reform the pact , or rather , to adjust its implementing measures .
cereals of inadequate quality for use or storage should not be accepted into intervention .
overseas departments
all imports originating in the usa are made via related traders , who , while measures were in place , were found to have obtained market conform profit margins during the rip .
let me explain this by first detailing what we are not going to do .
where there is no reply within five months of the date of the verification request or where the reply does not contain sufficient information to demonstrate the real origin of the products , the customs authorities of the country of export shall declare invalid the proof of origin established on the basis of the documents in question .. &quot;
this is a particularly important requirement as regards the fight against serious and organised crime .
in article 54 of regulation ( ec ) no 1043 / 2005 , the following paragraphs 3 to 6 are added :
questionnaire replies were received from six chinese exporting producers , from the sole ukrainian exporting producer , from four community producers , from two importers not related to the exporting producers and from one trader .
we shall ensure , in particular , that negotiations are driven forward on the european evidence warrant and on the possible establishment of a european criminal record .
relating in particular to the additional and supplementary quotas already allocated on the date on which the communication is drawn up .
the fight against terrorism must be a permanent priority .
there appears to be 90000 tonnes spare capacity in the usa , the low utilisation rate during the ip being a consequence of temporary events , and the use of an estimated 27 % of us installed capacity could not be investigated due to a lack of cooperation .
authorising the placing on the market of infant formulae based on hydrolysates of whey protein derived from cows &quot; milk protein for a two-year period
if we do not succeed in making the eu an area of work and well-being for all , the citizens will become alienated from europe , from its union and from the political project that underpins it .
on this basis it was examined whether , despite the conclusion on the likelihood of a continuation of dumping and likelihood of recurrence of injury , compelling reasons exist which would lead to the conclusion , in this particular case , that it is not in the community interest to maintain measures .
after five years of qualified success , the time has come for a mid-term review , which we shall draw up for the spring european council .
we must act now in order , in the future , to guarantee access for all to the european social model , which must not be turned into a myth , but should remain , or rather , should return to being , a living reality for all .
the community industry &apos;s export volumes to third countries increased by 11 % over the period considered which corresponds to 4 % on average on an annual basis , which is largely in line with the expansion of world consumption .
we must explain to them that the reforms that we are proposing are intended to guarantee the survival and the viability of the european social model .
name and position , name and address of company .
i am well aware that europe has a competitiveness problem , which largely explains its mediocre performance in terms of growth and jobs .
it is not , however , an end in itself , nor some neutral , self-sufficient benefit .
no , the competitiveness that we must seek should provide us with stronger and more sustainable growth and should be aimed at greater social cohesion and a more harmoniously-balanced environment .
for the world to be a stable place , it needs a transatlantic partnership that works .
peel shall , however , be excluded ;
slices
the russian federation is a strategic partner of the eu and remains a major factor in european security and stability .
the new constitutional treaty paves the way towards definitively abolishing the &quot; justice and home affairs exception , &quot; in other words the complete integration of this field into the european project by means of the rigorous application of the community method .
as regards bulgaria and romania , i hope that parliament will issue its assent in april on the accession of those two countries , which will enable us to sign accession treaties , also in april .
against this backdrop , i should like to offer my support to the middle east conference due to take place in london in march 2005 .
at this point , mr president , i should like to say a word about the middle east .
transatlantic relations would not be complete without canada , and i am delighted that there is to be a summit with canada during my presidency , in which we shall be discussing matters of shared importance between friends .
let us not forget that the treaty is a text that is of neither the left nor the right .
the production process is largely automated and therefore not labour-intensive .
passport no : mp 0515811 . &quot;
fraud or failure to provide administrative cooperation
the council , for its part , is not the field of play of exclusively national interests , however justified those may be , but rather a workshop of understanding .
as % of dry matter . &quot;
the opening of accession negotiations with croatia in march 2005 , provided that there has been confirmation of complete cooperation with the criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia , will demonstrate to all balkan countries that their efforts towards democracy will be rewarded and might bear more fruit .
the request was lodged by cefic on behalf of producers representing a major proportion , in this case more than 75 % , of the total community production of ethanolamine .
the production capacity increase between 2002 and 2003 is marginal and reflects some efficiency improvements .
the future of the balkans , a region still traumatised by its recent past , must form part of europe &apos;s outlook .
this cost reduction , under the hypothesis that the abolition of measures would be fully translated into a lower purchase price , would reduce the cost of tea by approximately 7 % .
it is absolutely crucial that , in a coherent and coordinated fashion , we use the entire range of eu instruments in the western balkans , in the middle east , in our relations with russia and ukraine and in our transatlantic relations .
this tragedy will linger long in the memory and i hope that , in addition to the immediate emergency aid , we shall show lasting solidarity with the devastated peoples and regions of asia .
let us not put off the most difficult decisions until the day after the first referendum , then until the day after the second referendum , then until the day after the third referendum , and so on .
i should like to extend my sincere thanks to everyone , and especially to commissioner frattini again for being prepared to remain so long in the chamber with us for question time .
we saw this house spied on in a disgraceful manner during the last election period , and it appears that this is already happening again , in that i heard yesterday that at least one attendance list from december 2004 was given - i stress given - to a member in order that he might make a copy of it .
madam president , i would like to make a few remarks : some of my fellow members , like myself , have been here since the start of the sitting , have submitted written questions and have not had the opportunity of receiving a reply in the chamber which they could then counter with a further question , whether they were satisfied or not .
ethanolamines are obtained by making ethylene oxide ( eo ) , itself a result of a reaction of ethylene and oxygen , react with ammonia .
it is absolutely intolerable for a situation of this kind to arise .
the eu made significant progress under the dutch presidency .
fixing the maximum aid for concentrated butter for the 19th individual invitation to tender opened under the standing invitation to tender provided for in regulation ( ec ) no 1898 / 2005
the next item is the council statement on the programme of the luxembourg presidency .
the question is , therefore : what is the commission going to do in political terms to put the policy into practice ?
minimum zeleny index ( ml )
. the commission will begin to set out the action plan for the implementation of the hague programme at the informal meeting of the ministers for internal affairs and for justice at the end of the month .
what progress is the commission making towards proposing a standardised set of criteria for the reporting of crimes and collection of statistics about crimes across the european union ?
essential and semi-essential amino acids in breast milk as set out in annex v to directive 91 / 321 / eec .
having regard to council regulation ( ec ) no 318 / 2006 of 20 february 2006 on the common organisation of the markets in the sugar sector &#91; 1 &#93; , and in particular article 10 ( 1 ) thereof ,
no action shall be taken on the tenders notified from 20 to 26 october 2006 in response to the invitation to tender for the refund for the export of common wheat issued in regulation ( ec ) no 936 / 2006 .
in accordance with regulation ( ec ) no 765 / 2006 , all funds and economic resources belonging to , owned , held or controlled by president lukashenko as well as those belonging to , owned , held or controlled by certain other officials of belarus who are responsible for the violations of international electoral standards in the presidential elections in belarus on 19 march 2006 and the crackdown on civil society and democratic opposition , and those natural or legal persons , entities and bodies associated with them , as listed in annex i to that regulation , are frozen .
imports from other third countries , volume , market share and import prices
it is recalled that exporting producers in the usa were still practicing dumping during the rip , even if at a reduced level compared to the previous investigation .
we must not disappoint the people whom we have , to some degree , motivated to summon up the courage to bring about changes , and whom we have helped to do so in a transparent manner .
over the period considered , production has increased by 41 % .
mr president , i welcome the presidency and congratulate it on its priorities .
that is what we have achieved , and we will continue to do so if we get stuck in and , as has been said , do not limit ourselves to supplying funds but also help the palestinian people to gain a state of their own .
commission regulation ( ec ) no 824 / 2000 &#91; 2 &#93; does not explicitly specify the deadline for taking over cereals offered into intervention .
i would , though , also like to endorse what you said about the foreign policy aspects .
we are told that the german government does not want one before the next elections , but , at the same time , the german model - as regards members &quot; remuneration rather than additional earnings and lobbyists - could serve as a basis for an agreement of this kind .
mr president , mr president-in-office of the council , mr president of the commission , ladies and gentlemen , luxembourg &apos;s presidency of the council in this first half of 2005 is very probably the last of its kind that we shall see .
the sole ukrainian exporting producer requested met pursuant to article 2 ( 7 ) ( b ) of the basic regulation and replied to the met claim form for exporting producers within the given deadlines .
i undertake to make available to the customs authorities any further supporting documents they require :
over the period 2002 to 2003 , return on investment was not considered sufficiently high in order to warrant the installation of additional production installations .
the market share of the main exporting other countries , mainly russia and iran , has indeed become marginal .
i could also introduce you to those commercial service providers , including the coffee shop &apos; de tevreden roker &apos; &#91; the satisfied smoker &#93; and the &apos; picobello escort service &apos; club , which would certainly be keen to become active in luxembourg , or elsewhere for that matter .
we may then be able to have the desperately needed debate about the services directive , which seems to be absent in too many crucial places in europe .
. mr president , mr juncker &apos;s speech was made with all the passion that a civil servant is likely to raise .
the quantities ( tonnes ) of products imported under this regulation , broken down by combined nomenclature code ( cn code ) ,
is that still your opinion ?
the second subparagraph of article 8 ( 1 ) of regulation ( ec ) no 1788 / 2003 as added by council regulation ( ec ) no 1406 / 2006 provides that for the 2005 / 2006 period the commission may adapt the division between &quot; deliveries &quot; and &quot; direct sales &quot; of the national reference quantities at the request of the czech republic , estonia , cyprus , latvia , lithuania , hungary , poland , slovenia and slovakia .
you also said that you have a window of opportunity to cut a quick deal on the eu budget , including the british rebate of some eur 4 billion a year .
on the issue of rice import licences for applications lodged in the first 10 working days of october 2006 under regulation ( ec ) no 327 / 98
commission regulation ( ec ) no 1606 / 2006
i urge you to give the public the opportunity to make up their own minds in a fair-minded manner .
both factors would be alleviated if the anti-dumping measures were allowed to lapse .
in fact , we agree with you and disagree with mr barroso ; competitiveness must go hand in hand with sustainable growth , with social solidarity and environmental responsibility .
it is therefore necessary to lay down provisions regulating the management of these tariff quotas .
therefore , these products are provisionally considered to be alike within the meaning of article 1 ( 4 ) of the basic regulation .
reducing the european budget is in fact tantamount to letting europe collapse .
if the stingy countries - by which i mean countries and governments that are very close to me - prevail with their 1 % , europe will be the loser .
neither should you underestimate the challenge of enforcing existing directives .
the average price level of sales to unrelated customers followed a similar pattern and after a decrease of 5 % between 2002 and 2003 , the price level in the free market during the rip was 17 % higher than in 2002 .
since 2004 , the market for mea has increased considerably following a us regulation , effective 1 january 2005 , prohibiting the use of alternative metal based products for wood treatment , causing an additional estimated demand of mea of 80000 tonnes .
your proposal to make national governments accountable to their peers , as well as to national parliaments and public opinion , is a good one and the commission must be entrusted to monitor the measures needed and not be afraid to name and shame the laggards .
as mr poettering said , we cannot ignore the momentous events in ukraine in the last two months .
in conclusion , as the constitution enters its ratification phase , you may have three referenda on your watch , and you must do all in your power to make sure they succeed .
we will look to you and your council colleagues to be vigilant and true to your commitments .
amending regulation ( eec ) no 1907 / 90 , as regards the derogation on egg washing
in the event of a practice that may justify application by the community of the measures provided for in article 37 of the interim agreement , and thereafter article 71 of the saa , the commission shall , after examining the case , on its own initiative or on the request of a member state , decide whether such practice is compatible with the agreements .
my group will call upon you to specify new arrangements for the stability and growth pact , which underpins the single currency .
if france and germany are allowed to escape with a mild rebuke for exceeding the deficit limits for several consecutive years , if greece is absolved from misrepresenting its true fiscal state to gain fast-track entry to the euro , and if italy continues to be reckless with its budget while harbouring a public debt of over 100 % , who will have confidence in those rules ?
derogating from regulations ( ec ) no 327 / 1998 and ( ec ) no 1291 / 2000 as regards certain import licences issued for the july 2006 tranche of tariff quotas for imports of rice and broken rice
notwithstanding article 8 ( 3 ) of regulation ( ec ) no 1291 / 2000 , the import licences referred to in article 1 of this regulation issued for quotas with the serial numbers 09.4148 and 09.4166 may be used for imports of rice originating in all non-member countries , without prejudice to paragraph 1 of this article .
nonetheless , we , too , recognise that the european union has justifiable ambitions , whether to run a coherent security strategy , generous development policy or an effective policy of regional aid and social cohesion .
. mr president , this is the eleventh luxembourg presidency .
relaunching lisbon , the &quot; intelligent &quot; stability and growth pact , financial perspectives that actually offer new perspectives for europe : these are the herculean tasks facing the luxembourg presidency .
on 4 february 2006 , the commission announced by a notice published in the official journal of the european union &#91; 2 &#93; ( notice of initiation ) , the initiation of an anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports into the community of ironing boards originating in the people &apos;s republic of china ( prc ) and ukraine .
the european socialists have high hopes for this luxembourg presidency , primarily from the point of view of relaunching the lisbon strategy and of turning it into a genuine instrument of progress , particularly at the level of the 25 .
high and increasing demand compared to a lower pace of capacity expansion and overall reduction of imports have sustained the price level of ethanolamine in the community .
moreover , the sales margins have hardly been influenced by the full cost of production per tonne over the period considered , as the price increase was mainly due to market developments .
measures decided on by the commission pursuant to paragraph 1 may be referred to the council by any member state within three working days of the date on which they were notified. the council shall meet without delay .
summary of the analysis of the likelihood of the continuation of dumping and of the recurrence of injurious dumping
for us , that is social policy in the true sense of the word .
rather than setting ecology and the protection of the environment against the economy , we need a sensible balance between them .
commission regulation ( ec ) no 1588 / 2006
the commission strongly supports the efforts of the luxembourg presidency on this path. the commission believes that this period is critical and that our institutions will need to work together even more closely to achieve results .
i believe that the european union will play a stronger role on the international scene .
the construction of the keypad , in particular the shape , as well as the positioning , the layout and the print of the keycaps lead to classification of the keypad under cn code 85299040 as a part for use solely or principally with apparatus of heading 8525 .
although we were very pleased to see the president of the commission and the president of the council in asia , visiting jakarta as an expression of the european union &apos;s solidarity , i would like to emphasise that , however necessary solidarity with the stricken areas might be , we must not overlook the great problems in africa and in other parts of the world .
the evolution of the cash flow is a further illustration of the link between price levels , profitability and the return on investment .
let us be clear on this matter : that would be a europe that reneges on its commitments .
only users from the esterquat business for fabric softeners came forward in this investigation .
i honestly believe that the longer we leave this , the more difficult it will be .
imports from other third countries halved over the period considered .
the citizens of europe expect us to have the ability to work together .
there might be something else , but not a union .
indeed , european level expenditure very often brings more reward than national level expenditure without coherence .
in the event of a practice which is liable to warrant application by the community of the measures provided for in article 24 ( 2 ) of the interim agreement , and thereafter article 37 ( 2 ) of the saa , the introduction of anti-dumping and / or countervailing measures shall be decided upon in accordance with the provisions laid down in regulation ( ec ) no 384 / 96 or regulation ( ec ) no 2026 / 97 , respectively .
allocation coefficients as provided for in article 25 ( 1 ) of regulation ( ec ) no 1282 / 2006 should therefore be fixed .
the commission &apos;s proposal has not fallen out of the sky ; it is the result of commitments agreed by the eu during the european councils .
gorovtsa 4-104 , minsk , belarus
it is right to do so , because failure to reach an agreement in time will lead to significant difficulties for the preparation of the programmes concerned .
. as i stated in my reply , the commission has treated this matter with considerable urgency , when we asked the council to give us the go-ahead and when we engaged in negotiations .
hopefully , with goodwill on all sides , the matter can be brought to a satisfactory conclusion in the near future .
. the commission wishes to stress that removing internal market barriers is not tantamount to undermining the quality of services , or that the services directive will lead to social dumping - quite the contrary .
only a small part is sold to the retail industry and catering industry for direct consumption .
therefore , companies cannot use this proposal in order to establish themselves in low-wage countries to circumvent the social protection of the host member state .
for services provided via an establishment in another member state - for example a hospital or a home for the elderly - the service provider will have to comply with all the relevant rules in that member state .
article 4 ( 2 ) , first subparagraph , first sentence
the commission has committed to a genuine dialogue with both co-legislators and interested parties with a view to finding solutions to specific areas of concern .
the rest of the directive deals with any other areas .
blemished units .
if it is simply to provide for the provision of temporary cross-border provisions , how does it lead to a competitive integrated services market ?
section 8 of licence applications and licences shall show the country of origin ;
hops are no longer grown in ireland and therefore , in the interests of clarity and logic , commission regulation ( eec ) no 1375 / 75 of 29 may 1975 on the provisions of recognition of producer groups for hops in ireland &#91; 3 &#93; should be repealed .
would the commissioner agree that it is vitally important for members of this house to understand the huge variety of discriminatory and anti-competitive practices that member states currently apply against service providers ?
hewa bora airways is allowed to use the specific aircraft mentioned in annex b for its current operations within the european community .
i agree with the honourable member that many anti-competitive practices exist in lots of member states that prevent the real opening-up of the services market .
the tolerances allowed , other than those fixed by reference to per cent by number , are per 10 kilograms drained net weight .
consequently air service comores should be subject to operational restrictions and should be moved from annex a to annex b .
but having said that , and in reply to the earlier question from mr de rossa , i am also conscious of the specific concerns expressed by members .
containers with a nominal water capacity of
standing still is not an option .
people come to various issues in this house from various perspectives , with their own experiences and political and economic philosophies .
this data is therefore production based rather than sales based .
commission regulation ( ec ) no 1559 / 2006
as i pointed out in reply to mr harbour , services make up the bulk of the european union &apos;s economic activity , therefore it is a goal well worth fighting for .
for the purpose of this regulation the styles are defined as follows :
the figures concerning the total production of the product concerned by the community industry and other producers in the community derive from estimates from the relevant authorities and associations in the member states where frozen strawberries are produced , notably ierigez for poland , fruitveb for hungary , assomela for italy and the ministry of agriculture in spain .
this communication was a response to the set of recommendations by the high level group on textiles and clothing , in which trade unions were represented .
therefore , even if the decreased export performance of the community industry might have contributed to the injury suffered , the overall effect cannot be considered as significant and cannot break the causal link between the dumped imports and the injury suffered by the community industry .
european consumers are faced with the possibility that some of the chocolate they eat has been produced by forced labour .
the international labour organisation , through its international programme on the elimination of child labour , launched in 2000 a new initiative called &apos; combating trafficking in children for labour exploitation in west and central africa &apos; .
has the commission considered that and will the commission consider it ?
moreover , it considers that poverty and the lack of local opportunities are amongst the main reasons for exploitative child labour and child trafficking .
in addition to the cotonou provisions on trade and labour standards , the ecowas heads of state have adopted a declaration and a plan of action to fight child exploitation , and ecowas has recently set up a child unit in its secretariat .
i am at a loss as to why chocolate has been singled out in this respect because there are many other food products being sourced from third world countries where the same issues pertain - labelling issues and quality standards are very important across the whole of the sector .
this potential disruption arises from russian insistence that eu exports meet its specific import requirements .
foreign material of vegetable origin :
hence , it will be impossible to resolve the problem without dialogue between all the parties .
i wish to express my indignation at the commission &apos;s stated position that the issue of veterinary inspections by the russian federation is an internal matter for the above states .
it has been examined whether compelling reasons exist that could lead to the conclusion that it would not be in the community interest to impose anti-dumping duties against imports from the country concerned .
the honourable member can be assured , therefore , that although the commission has very little competence in relation to export requirements in third countries , it has expressed its willingness and has been proactive in view of helping to solve this kind of problem and , as soon as the commission was given the green light from the council , it engaged in timely negotiations .
to commission regulation of 17 october 2006 establishing the standard import values for determining the entry price of certain fruit and vegetables
strawberries are a popular flavour in the fruit preparation and dairy industry and hold an important part of the overall production in both of these sectors .
however , each applicant may lodge several applications for import licences for products referred to in annex i , if these products originate in different countries .
it must consequently be considered to be in the interest also for the users to ensure the continuation of the community production .
i do not believe that any of us here feel that the relatives we have in third countries have harmed those countries , nor do the host countries feel that they have harmed them .
their experiences might even enable us to make it easier for our own citizens - identifying as they will with them - to understand the benefits of legal migration to europe .
i am not familiar with the green paper , but i would like this document to contain provisions to ensure that in future europe will not be suspected or accused , as has sometimes been the case with the united states , of causing a &quot; brain drain &quot; from poor countries .
the estimated frozen strawberry consumption for this sector would amount to around 100000 tonnes per year .
moreover , the sales prices of the community industry were under strong pressure from the dumped imports which also contributed to the negative impact upon those indicators .
the countries affected are frequently poor countries , whose development depends to a large extent on the education of such an elite .
even assuming the industry suffered from structural deficiencies during the period considered , it is noted that the industry continually invested in the period considered .
mr president , i am particularly keen to pick up on mrs lambert &apos;s comments on transition periods .
it was argued by certain interested parties that some of the 26 cooperating companies had withdrawn their support for the proceedings .
for the sake of clarity , it is necessary to use a single model for communicating the quantities between member states and the commission .
we should do our best to avoid perpetuating the absurd situation whereby third-country nationals are invited to work in the european union or in the european labour market whilst restrictions on employment opportunities for those from eu member states are still in place .
in consequence , the estimated market share of the prc has increased significantly during the period considered from 4 % in 2002 to 20 % in the ip .
these steps have significantly contributed to improving the sampled community industry &apos;s efficiency .
( oj l 220 , 29.7.1989 , p . 51 )
i have a number of questions .
the trade unions will demand parity of treatment for third country nationals coming to work in the european union , so that they are not paid poorly to undercut workers here .
the commission subsequently identified those product types sold domestically by the company having overall representative domestic sales that were identical or directly comparable with the types sold for export to the community .
therefore , it is provisionally considered that the impact on users would not be substantial .
the administration of the arrangements should be based on import licences .
regulation as last amended by regulation ( ec ) no 1815 / 2005 ( oj l 292 , 8.11.2005 , p . 4 ) .
this issue of brain drain and what to do about it will be one of the key subjects in the particular and specific communication on migration and development , which the commission will present in spring 2005 .
for each harvest , the member states shall send the commission the information detailed in the annex by electronic means by 15 april of the year following the harvest concerned .
due to the decrease in production in the ip the productivity and the employment numbers declined .
moreover , it is likely to vary greatly depending on country conditions , the ability to achieve competitive advantages in the higher value added production segment and domestic policy responses .
and we want to be able to live together in peace and friendship with the other peoples of the spanish state , on the basis of mutual respect for different identities and languages , free accession and common work within a united europe .
the commission shall decide as quickly as possible to what extent quantities may be awarded in respect of applications as referred to in article 3 .
economists in the nord-pas-de-calais region are already speaking about the loss of 9 000 of the 29 000 direct jobs in the textile industry in that area .
total in tonnes for product
the quantity of products which benefit from that regime and the level of custom duty are set out in annex i .
we are concerned , however , by the productivity approach , as , moreover , you yourself called it in an interview for an italian newspaper : that is , the decision to make migratory flows conditional on the requirements of the european labour market .
commissioner , do you not agree that application of this principle could mark the end of a common european immigration policy , as well as a step backwards from what many member states have already achieved ?
the first reason why i am reasonably optimistic over the possibility of attaining a tangible result , namely the adoption of a european initiative , is that , with regard to 2001 , it was the european council - the very institution which in 2001 did not allow a similar measure to be adopted - which in november 2004 called on the commission to adopt a european initiative by the end of 2005 .
it is estimated that some 110000 tonnes of strawberries are consumed by the fresh dairy and ice cream industry .
these prices were compared with the sales prices charged by the chinese exporting producers net of discounts and adjusted where necessary to cif community frontier with an appropriate adjustment for the customs clearance costs and post-importation costs .
impact of alleged structural deficiencies with community producers
i think that the peillon report about admitting third-country scientists and researchers is a case in point .
this regulation shall enter into force on 18 october 2006 .
mr president , commissioner , thank you for the green paper .
since action was urgently required , and still is , i am delighted with it .
the user industry has demonstrated that the product concerned constitutes a substantial part of the cost of production of jams ( around 30 % to 40 % ) .
with regard to one point i will , of course , confirm a commitment which you can already guess : the commission will not confine itself to listening to advice , but will take into account the assessments and proposals that it gathers .
the answers will come from the public debate which will be starting , from parliament and from the social actors to whom we shall listen .
i would reiterate once more to those who asked again that today i cannot give any options or preferences among possible abstract solutions .
on this basis it was established that the level of cooperation was low , i.e. 37 % of the overall chinese exports to the community .
these are areas that the commission will be developing this year , in close cooperation with parliament and the presidency .
the possibility of a minor decrease in consumption in 2004 can therefore not be ruled out .
there are instruments , including within the national states , which allow a judge who has carried out an illegal activity to be prosecuted , but that clearly cannot happen at the request of the commission .
commissioner , regardless of the facts of this case , when you next meet the justice ministers , will you make it clear to them that , under the various international conventions you mention and in the spirit of membership of the european union , it is unacceptable for the authorities of one member state - be they political or judicial - to carry out phone tapping in another member state , without the express approval of that member state ?
the situation of the community industry in the ip was further aggravated by the massive increase of more than 40 % in import volumes from the prc .
on this basis the provisional weighted average dumping margin expressed as a percentage of the cif community frontier price duty unpaid is ;
10 units
it is certainly true that there are different approaches to integration represented in the member states .
is it admissible , in the absence of a court order by a member state , for telephone conversations by citizens of that member state to be monitored by the authorities of another member state ?
in addition to the notifications required under article 3 ( 2 ) of regulation ( eec ) no 2204 / 90 , member states shall submit to the commission before the end of each quarter the following information on the previous quarter :

this is because , rather than merely recognising common fundamental values , it was decided to share those values in legislative acts ; because the constitution prioritises norms over permanent negotiation ; because it affirms the sovereignty of acts and the inalienable dignity of man as a reason for , and an objective of , european policies ; because it articulates a programme of global justice that transcends national interests and complements the effectiveness of member states &quot; internal constitutions ; because it brings together modern european political identity in a system of universal values incorporating all of the other identities ; because it represents the sense of belonging to a cosmopolitan and anthropocentric world ; because it is the starting point for a league of nations in a more rational and more balanced world ; because it is the constitutional homeland with which all homelands identify in this europe , with a view to creating a new europe .

should measures be imposed , the community industry would probably be in a position to sell the product concerned at higher prices and thereby to offer higher prices to the suppliers of strawberries as well .

firstly , an integral feature of the new constitutional treaty is that it provides us with values concerning not merely democracy and human rights , but also the environment and social responsibility .
information to be sent to the commission by 15 april of the year following that of the harvest concerned
with regard to the community producers the commission selected , in accordance with article 17 ( 1 ) of the basic regulation , a sample of eight companies based on the largest representative volume of production in the community ( around 14 % ) , which could be reasonably investigated within the time available .
the difficulties revealed by the opinions of the other committees will resurface sooner or later .
that is the case with all constitutions , and with this treaty no less than with others .
there is a need for a better balance to be struck between what happens at the centre and away from it , in brussels , in the nation states and in regions and municipalities .
the european union has now also recognised and enshrined the task of the regional dimension , namely local and regional authorities .
&quot; oak-cask matured &quot;

the competent authority shall check the identification of all animals on the holding .
it is an important step that the european parliament supports this and remains critical about the way in which this treaty will be fleshed out at local or regional level in the next few years .
the treaty text reinforces the position of regions and towns , which are close to the citizens and where important tasks are carried out in many areas .
cirfs and certain community producers have simply made a different forecast on the likelihood of recurrence of dumped psf exports to the community for the countries concerned. it has tried to support its forecast by references to products other than psf .
of course , it now remains to be applied and this is where the meps and the governments have a huge responsibility .

commission regulation ( ec ) no 1521 / 2006
nonetheless , we shall be part of this long and treacherous process that is the ratification of the constitutional treaty .
i consider that approval of the report is the condition for establishing parliament &apos;s authority in respect of the constitutional treaty , but i am sorry that amendments tabled by a number of us have been rejected .
there is no doubt that if we explain to the people what the constitution means , the people will be more in favour than against it , because they understand how logical is the unification of europe , that it makes sense and that it is in their interest .
after all , when one compares the arguments in favour of this constitution with the arguments against , one will not take long to conclude that the constitution has much more that is good in it than bad and it merits the support of the european citizens .
however , no specific evidence was provided in this respect .
in this respect , article 1.47 , relating to participatory democracy , is an innovation , so much so that it is scarcely referred to in our national constitutions .
to conclude , the injury consists primarily in price depression along with an increase in stocks. this resulted in heavy losses for the community producers during the ip .

moreover , it was this parliament that instigated this constitutional process .
the maximum percentages to be incorporated , as referred to in the second paragraph of article 1 of regulation ( eec ) no 2204 / 90 , are given in annex i to this regulation .
to those people i would say : be honest and campaign for what you really believe in , which is your country leaving the european union , and do not hide behind attacking the constitution .
let me conclude by saying that this debate is partly one of myth against reality .
even in exercising its powers , the council - i.e. the member states - has a central role in taking decisions , while the central administration - the european commission - has fewer employees than the city of leeds , in my constituency .
i am hopeful that in the vote tomorrow there will be at least a two-thirds majority in favour of it , with more than 400 votes in favour in this parliament , and that will send a powerful signal .
as a result , sales by the community fell significantly in this season and left the community producers with a very high level of stock at the end of the year .
the authorities of kyrgyz republic have provided the commission with evidence of the withdrawal of the air operator &apos;s certificates of the following two air carriers : phoenix aviation and star jet .

the decrease in stock in the year 2003 was a result of the poor harvest that in turn had an impact on the availability of raw materials to the community industry in this year .
it was the council that was unable to bring about an agreement .
the investigation showed that their sales volumes , sold at a net sales price equal to or above the unit cost , represented more than 80 % of the total sales volume of each producer .
member states shall ensure that the information collected from undertakings is treated as confidential .
the price of fresh strawberries destined for the processing industry has traditionally fluctuated depending on the supply and the size of the harvest .
i do believe that we must pay tribute to the commission for not having despaired but for having reopened a necessary and useful debate .
commission regulation ( ec ) no 1539 / 2006 of 13 october 2006 adopting a plan allocating resources to the member states to be charged against the 2007 budget year for the supply of food from intervention stocks for the benefit of the most deprived persons in the community &#91; 3 &#93; states that 33224 tonnes of sugar in storage must be withdrawn from the community &apos;s intervention stocks for distribution in the member states in accordance with annex i to this regulation .
given that chinese prices in the ip had dropped further in comparison to 2004 , the community industry had again to drop its prices ( by almost 24 % ) in order to sell off these stocks .
