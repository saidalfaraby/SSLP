in all of these instances , microsoft access must pass a string to the microsoft access database engine .
in the browser , the standard list displays all standards available in the style library .
when working with data access objects ( dao ) or activex data objects ( ado ) , you may need to construct an sql statement in code. this is sometimes referred to as taking your sql code inline. for example , if you &apos;re creating a new querydef object , you must set its sql property to a valid sql string. but if you are using an ado recordset object , you must set its source property to a valid sql string .

you should include single quotation marks in the criteria argument in such a way that when the value of the variable is concatenated into the string , it will be enclosed within the single quotation marks. for instance , suppose your criteria argument must contain a string variable called strname . you could construct the criteria argument as in the following example :

database servers typically use a server name , application name , and database name in the creation of unique identifiers. the nature of these identifiers makes database references less portable. web analysis studio uses user-friendly database aliases instead of long identifiers. not only are database connection names easier to remember and more economical to employ , they enable the database to be maintained on multiple servers .
other properties can be set only when a control doesn &apos;t have the focus .
you can move the focus only to a visible control or form. a form and controls on a form aren &apos;t visible until the form &apos;s load event has finished. therefore , if you use the setfocus method in a form &apos;s load event to move the focus to that form , you must use the repaint method before the setfocus method .

if there is no newname or newalias attribute for the dim element , it is not renamed. an example of this could be the case when a dimension name did not change , but members within that dimension were renamed. the oldalias attribute should be included if it is defined in the outline , so that top level member selections using the alias can be identified. this is necessary because in essbase or essbase , the top level member of a dimension uses the dimension name and alias. because members may be stored by name or alias in repository objects , oldname and oldalias must be included for all dim elements. this element can contain zero or moremember elements only. this would be the case if only the dimension name or alias changed , but no members in that dimension were renamed .
